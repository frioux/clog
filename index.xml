      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s ([wbm])  This is a very unique flavor profile. From the dry grounds, berry and spice notes are clear, as well as malt sugars and honey. My lightest roasts have a graham cracker wet aroma, with a lemon bar like smell as well. City+ level has more honey sweetness, prominent berry tones, and sweet spice notes of ginger, and herbs. A floral jasmine tea note and spice accents come through clearly in the cup, and vibrant citrus weaves through it all.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  The sweetness smelled in the dry fragrance has the pungency of black strap molasses with peppery tobacco accents. Both City+ and Full City roasts have potent, rustic sweetness, mixing syrupy fruit smells with earth-toned bittersweetness. The aroma is quite herbal, and a complex mix of bittersweet cocoa and green herbals are released on the break. The cup is complex, malt syrups with bell pepper and burdock root accents as it cools.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s (wbm)  Thageini has a big berry-like fragrance coming out of the grinder, red raspberry and aromatic sugar notes builiding out a sweet smelling profile. This perfumed mix continues into the wet aroma, smells of fruits cooked with molasses sugars coming off the steaming coffee crust, and a baking spice note accenting the steam. Berry and unrefined sugar notes are the first flavors that come to mind when sipping the hot cup, like red berry cooked down to a sugary pastry filling, along with an orange rind note that adds a tartness to the profile.</description>

      <title>Kenya Kirinyaga Thunguri Peaberry</title>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">222aa5c7-37d6-4121-b7b8-90f99c0c4fdf</guid>
      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s ([wbm])  The dry fragrance has a spiced grape smell, with a subtle citrus feature wrapped in maple sugar sweetness. Aromatically too, I picked up on a smell of citrus, more like dried/candied lemon peel, and with sweet layers of sugar browning smells. The cup of City roasts most echoes the notes on aroma, and you won&amp;rsquo;t be disappointed if light roasting is your preference. A soft lemonade note comes through along with a floral orange tea accent, and acidity has a slight grabbiness to it, akin to pink grapefruit.</description>

      <title>La Tacita Floral Gesha Blend</title>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  La Tacita Floral proves that when it comes to espresso, a little Gesha cultivar goes a long way. To be fair, 1&amp;frasl;3 is no small amount, and from the high level of floral flavor and aroma found in the shot, I&amp;rsquo;d believe it if I were told this was 100% Gesha cultivar. We roasted several batches of this blend, and some of my favorites were on the lighter end of the roast spectrum, but with stretched roast times.</description>

      <title>Ethiopia Dry Process Uraga Tome</title>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s [wbm]  We bought two lots from Tome, one wet processed, and this dry processed. They&amp;rsquo;re both beautiful cups, and a side by side comparison shows just how much processing influences the cup. This DP is so fruit forward in comparison, strong dried and fresh fruit flavors, and sweetness with matched intensity. At City and City+ roast levels, the smells from the ground and wetted coffee are pretty incredible, peach, mango, molasses, raisiny dried fruit, and even subtle floral highllights.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">ba2dc5be-2097-48aa-a907-f2bc23fda9cb</guid>
      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  The dry fragrance has a mix of sugar browning and spice smells in light to middle roasting, dried ginger and molasses, a subtle dried cherry accent. The wet aroma has a more intense sweetness that comes off like spiced molasses cookies, characteristics sensed in the dry fragrance gaining potency, and a whisp of florals comes through when breaking through the crust. The cup meets expectations set by the aromatic profile, base brown sugar and molasses flavors build as the cup cools, and baking spice hints offer pleasant contrast.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s [wbm]  This Gesha lot makes for an interesting brew to say the least, tea notes proliferate in both aroma and cup flavors, from pearl jasmine to Assam teas. The cup is both floral and brisk, a flavor combo not necessarily unique to Gesha cultivar, but certainly unique to most Latin American coffees. An herbal sweetness marks the aroma, as do licorice tea, and a palm sugar scent as you near Full City.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Light roasts of Yukiro have tart fruit and delicate floral notes, citrus-like acidic impressions as bright as any Ethiopia we&amp;rsquo;ve had so far this year. City roasts are where the most clarity in cup flavors are acheived, citric to tannic acidity propping up the complex nature of the coffee. The fragrance and aroma smell of honey and raw sugar, and a scent of black tea is accented by a hint of lemon.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s (wbm)  Delicious and delicate, this wet processed lot from Hambela Hassan is as sweet as it is floral, complex top notes burgeoning from the cups of light and middle roasts, and vibrant acidity helps construct a dynamic cup. The dry fragrance has perfumed florals, with a smell of peaches and cream, and a soft hint of vanilla. The wetted grounds of City roasts extend an aroma of peach, apricot, and nectarine, fruited smells with the volume of a natural process coffee, but more tea-like, and delicate in nature.</description>
