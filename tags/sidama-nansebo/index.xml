      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  City and City+ roasting produce a fresh smelling coffee, sweet honey and simple syrup allusions are quite attractive in the ground coffee and a fragrant floral nectar note contrasts nicely. The wet aroma is delicate but with floral intensity. Honeysuckle and freesia florals are perfumed and complex and honey sweetness builds in the steam coming off the coffee. Light roasts are really where it&amp;rsquo;s at with this coffee, constructing a &amp;ldquo;light and bright&amp;rdquo; cup that brings to mind the floral and tea-like qualities of what we think of as archetypal characteristics of coffee from the Yirga Cheffe region.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Ethiopia Sidama Nansebo Ethiopia Gera Jimma Nano Challa Coop Guatemala Xinabajul San Pedro Necta Costa Rica Helsar Santa Lucia  Cupping Note: this coffee was ground fine instead of coarse by mistake and thus it is pretty notably distinct in flavor than it would be otherwise.
Acidity: Not especially acidic
Sweetness: canned peach sweetness
Mouthfeel: Very oily
Flavor: Bizarrely, this tastes like prune babyfood to me.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Nansebo has an herbal sweetness like rue, backed with a flavor of white honey in City/City+ roasting that makes for a deliciously sweet Ethiopian cup. Clove spice hints mark the dry fragrance, along with perfumed orange smells in our light roasts. The wet aroma has a canned peach scent that culminates in a likeness of peach pie with graham cracker crust. As a brewed coffee, Nansebo pushes a deep level of honey sweetness at a wide range of roasts, City and City+ roasts striking a nice level of balance between fruited sweetness and a orange-like brightness.</description>
