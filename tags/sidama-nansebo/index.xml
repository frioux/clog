      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Nansebo has an herbal sweetness like rue, backed with a flavor of white honey in City/City+ roasting that makes for a deliciously sweet Ethiopian cup. Clove spice hints mark the dry fragrance, along with perfumed orange smells in our light roasts. The wet aroma has a canned peach scent that culminates in a likeness of peach pie with graham cracker crust. As a brewed coffee, Nansebo pushes a deep level of honey sweetness at a wide range of roasts, City and City+ roasts striking a nice level of balance between fruited sweetness and a orange-like brightness.</description>
