      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  This Dumerso dry-processed lot is a powerhouse in terms of fruit-forward aromatics. The dry-fragrance has a cornucopia of fruits, raspberry and ripe blueberry, Turkish apricots, grape juice, along with a substantial backdrop of bittersweet burnt sugars. The fruits approach floral dimensions, and a start jasmine note accents the ground coffee. The wet aromatics are equally intense, a representation of blackberry and strawberry toppings, a hint of dried mango, and a cacao-like bittersweetness in our roasts closer to Full City.</description>
