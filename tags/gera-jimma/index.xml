      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Light roasts of Yukiro have tart fruit and delicate floral notes, citrus-like acidic impressions as bright as any Ethiopia we&amp;rsquo;ve had so far this year. City roasts are where the most clarity in cup flavors are acheived, citric to tannic acidity propping up the complex nature of the coffee. The fragrance and aroma smell of honey and raw sugar, and a scent of black tea is accented by a hint of lemon.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Nano Challa has a honey sweet smell in lightest roasts (City), stone fruit and tea suggestions, and sugary sweetness that finds it&amp;rsquo;s apex when adding hot water. Brown sugar and toffee smells are focused in the wet aroma, a candy sweetness that reminds me of torrone (minus the nuts), and the break releases a light accent of pearl jasmine tea, giving way to more weighty fruited smells that have elements of fruit cobbler.</description>

Sweetness: canned peach sweetness
Mouthfeel: Very oily
Flavor: Bizarrely, this tastes like prune babyfood to me.</description>
