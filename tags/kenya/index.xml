      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s ([wbm])  The dry fragrance has a spiced grape smell, with a subtle citrus feature wrapped in maple sugar sweetness. Aromatically too, I picked up on a smell of citrus, more like dried/candied lemon peel, and with sweet layers of sugar browning smells. The cup of City roasts most echoes the notes on aroma, and you won&amp;rsquo;t be disappointed if light roasting is your preference. A soft lemonade note comes through along with a floral orange tea accent, and acidity has a slight grabbiness to it, akin to pink grapefruit.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s (wbm)  Thageini has a big berry-like fragrance coming out of the grinder, red raspberry and aromatic sugar notes builiding out a sweet smelling profile. This perfumed mix continues into the wet aroma, smells of fruits cooked with molasses sugars coming off the steaming coffee crust, and a baking spice note accenting the steam. Berry and unrefined sugar notes are the first flavors that come to mind when sipping the hot cup, like red berry cooked down to a sugary pastry filling, along with an orange rind note that adds a tartness to the profile.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  The smells in the dry grounds of Riakiberu are attractive, City+ roasts offering a mix of malty sweetness, and berry jelly. Fruits are present without overpowering the aroma, and while smells of baked goods, caramelizing sugars, and such billow in the steam from the hot coffee, subtler accent notes like berry and melon compliment this sugary base. Riakiberu brews really well, City+ roasts promising flavors of sagarcane juice, cantelope, and an interesting herbal note of celery soda.</description>
