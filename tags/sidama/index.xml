      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  City and City+ roasting produce a fresh smelling coffee, sweet honey and simple syrup allusions are quite attractive in the ground coffee and a fragrant floral nectar note contrasts nicely. The wet aroma is delicate but with floral intensity. Honeysuckle and freesia florals are perfumed and complex and honey sweetness builds in the steam coming off the coffee. Light roasts are really where it&amp;rsquo;s at with this coffee, constructing a &amp;ldquo;light and bright&amp;rdquo; cup that brings to mind the floral and tea-like qualities of what we think of as archetypal characteristics of coffee from the Yirga Cheffe region.</description>
