      <title>La Tacita Floral Gesha Blend</title>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  La Tacita Floral proves that when it comes to espresso, a little Gesha cultivar goes a long way. To be fair, 1&amp;frasl;3 is no small amount, and from the high level of floral flavor and aroma found in the shot, I&amp;rsquo;d believe it if I were told this was 100% Gesha cultivar. We roasted several batches of this blend, and some of my favorites were on the lighter end of the roast spectrum, but with stretched roast times.</description>

I was surprised that it didn&amp;rsquo;t take longer! It was incredibly smoky and took quite a while to cool the beans.</description>
