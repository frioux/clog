      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  The sweetness smelled in the dry fragrance has the pungency of black strap molasses with peppery tobacco accents. Both City+ and Full City roasts have potent, rustic sweetness, mixing syrupy fruit smells with earth-toned bittersweetness. The aroma is quite herbal, and a complex mix of bittersweet cocoa and green herbals are released on the break. The cup is complex, malt syrups with bell pepper and burdock root accents as it cools.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s ([wbm])  The dry fragrance has a spiced grape smell, with a subtle citrus feature wrapped in maple sugar sweetness. Aromatically too, I picked up on a smell of citrus, more like dried/candied lemon peel, and with sweet layers of sugar browning smells. The cup of City roasts most echoes the notes on aroma, and you won&amp;rsquo;t be disappointed if light roasting is your preference. A soft lemonade note comes through along with a floral orange tea accent, and acidity has a slight grabbiness to it, akin to pink grapefruit.</description>
