      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  The dry fragrance touches on brown sugar and vanilla bean smells, along with a nice dried apple note. There&amp;rsquo;s a clean sweetness in the coffee smells, and the wet aromatics show characteristics of raw brown sugar, and definitely some fruit, but hard to put my finger on exactly what. A honey to brown sugar sweetness is striking in the brewed coffee, and lays a stabilizing groundwork on which the rest of the profile rests.</description>
