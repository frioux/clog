      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Peach and lime smells are released in the dry fragrance, a dried stone fruit sweetness and with zesty lime peel accents. Gidhey shows layered raw sugar sweetness in the ground coffee and wet aroma, warmed caramel-y smells released in the steam that have elements of caramelizing dark brown sugars, panela, sucanat, and more. City roasts are the most floral, a fresh aroma of gardenia flower coming through in the brewed coffee, along with a clean and sweet impression of simple syrup sweetener.</description>

      <title>Ethiopia Grade 1 Dry Process Yirga Cheffe Dumerso</title>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  This Dumerso dry-processed lot is a powerhouse in terms of fruit-forward aromatics. The dry-fragrance has a cornucopia of fruits, raspberry and ripe blueberry, Turkish apricots, grape juice, along with a substantial backdrop of bittersweet burnt sugars. The fruits approach floral dimensions, and a start jasmine note accents the ground coffee. The wet aromatics are equally intense, a representation of blackberry and strawberry toppings, a hint of dried mango, and a cacao-like bittersweetness in our roasts closer to Full City.</description>

      <guid>https://frioux.github.io/clog/posts/2018-06-14/</guid>
      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  The dry fragrance has a mix of sugar browning and spice smells in light to middle roasting, dried ginger and molasses, a subtle dried cherry accent. The wet aroma has a more intense sweetness that comes off like spiced molasses cookies, characteristics sensed in the dry fragrance gaining potency, and a whisp of florals comes through when breaking through the crust. The cup meets expectations set by the aromatic profile, base brown sugar and molasses flavors build as the cup cools, and baking spice hints offer pleasant contrast.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Nano Challa has a honey sweet smell in lightest roasts (City), stone fruit and tea suggestions, and sugary sweetness that finds it&amp;rsquo;s apex when adding hot water. Brown sugar and toffee smells are focused in the wet aroma, a candy sweetness that reminds me of torrone (minus the nuts), and the break releases a light accent of pearl jasmine tea, giving way to more weighty fruited smells that have elements of fruit cobbler.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Ethiopia Sidama Nansebo Ethiopia Gera Jimma Nano Challa Coop Guatemala Xinabajul San Pedro Necta Costa Rica Helsar Santa Lucia  Cupping Note: this coffee was ground fine instead of coarse by mistake and thus it is pretty notably distinct in flavor than it would be otherwise.
Acidity: Not especially acidic
Sweetness: canned peach sweetness
Mouthfeel: Very oily
Flavor: Bizarrely, this tastes like prune babyfood to me.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  We&amp;rsquo;re really pleased with this year&amp;rsquo;s lot of Baaroo. A balanced coffee, Baaroo&amp;rsquo;s profile has just the right levels of complex sugar browning sweetness and subtle top notes to reflect coffees from the origin. The dry fragrance has a smell of dark toffee, so sweet and candy-like, with an understated peach note of the canned, syrupy sweet variety. Adding hot water sees a boost in stone fruit aromatics, like apricot and brown sugar,, as well as a peak in sugary sweetness, a maple icing scent filling the steam.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Nansebo has an herbal sweetness like rue, backed with a flavor of white honey in City/City+ roasting that makes for a deliciously sweet Ethiopian cup. Clove spice hints mark the dry fragrance, along with perfumed orange smells in our light roasts. The wet aroma has a canned peach scent that culminates in a likeness of peach pie with graham cracker crust. As a brewed coffee, Nansebo pushes a deep level of honey sweetness at a wide range of roasts, City and City+ roasts striking a nice level of balance between fruited sweetness and a orange-like brightness.</description>

      <description>Blend  1lb Ethiopia Dry Process Yirga Cheffe Wenago 1&amp;frasl;4 lb Sumatra Aceh-Mandheling  Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Wenago is a nice late season Ethiopia, and anything but subtle: strawberry, raspberry, red apple, stone fruit, fading to sweet tobacco and aromatic wood notes in the long finish. (and above)
 Very little stone flavors. Fairly bland. Maybe this isn&amp;rsquo;t good for cold brew? ☹</description>
