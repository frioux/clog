      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s (wbm)  Delicious and delicate, this wet processed lot from Hambela Hassan is as sweet as it is floral, complex top notes burgeoning from the cups of light and middle roasts, and vibrant acidity helps construct a dynamic cup. The dry fragrance has perfumed florals, with a smell of peaches and cream, and a soft hint of vanilla. The wetted grounds of City roasts extend an aroma of peach, apricot, and nectarine, fruited smells with the volume of a natural process coffee, but more tea-like, and delicate in nature.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Peach and lime smells are released in the dry fragrance, a dried stone fruit sweetness and with zesty lime peel accents. Gidhey shows layered raw sugar sweetness in the ground coffee and wet aroma, warmed caramel-y smells released in the steam that have elements of caramelizing dark brown sugars, panela, sucanat, and more. City roasts are the most floral, a fresh aroma of gardenia flower coming through in the brewed coffee, along with a clean and sweet impression of simple syrup sweetener.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  We&amp;rsquo;re really pleased with this year&amp;rsquo;s lot of Baaroo. A balanced coffee, Baaroo&amp;rsquo;s profile has just the right levels of complex sugar browning sweetness and subtle top notes to reflect coffees from the origin. The dry fragrance has a smell of dark toffee, so sweet and candy-like, with an understated peach note of the canned, syrupy sweet variety. Adding hot water sees a boost in stone fruit aromatics, like apricot and brown sugar,, as well as a peak in sugary sweetness, a maple icing scent filling the steam.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s [wbm]  We bought two lots from Tome, one wet processed, and this dry processed. They&amp;rsquo;re both beautiful cups, and a side by side comparison shows just how much processing influences the cup. This DP is so fruit forward in comparison, strong dried and fresh fruit flavors, and sweetness with matched intensity. At City and City+ roast levels, the smells from the ground and wetted coffee are pretty incredible, peach, mango, molasses, raisiny dried fruit, and even subtle floral highllights.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Light roasts of Yukiro have tart fruit and delicate floral notes, citrus-like acidic impressions as bright as any Ethiopia we&amp;rsquo;ve had so far this year. City roasts are where the most clarity in cup flavors are acheived, citric to tannic acidity propping up the complex nature of the coffee. The fragrance and aroma smell of honey and raw sugar, and a scent of black tea is accented by a hint of lemon.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s ([wbm])  This is a very unique flavor profile. From the dry grounds, berry and spice notes are clear, as well as malt sugars and honey. My lightest roasts have a graham cracker wet aroma, with a lemon bar like smell as well. City+ level has more honey sweetness, prominent berry tones, and sweet spice notes of ginger, and herbs. A floral jasmine tea note and spice accents come through clearly in the cup, and vibrant citrus weaves through it all.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  The dry fragrance has a mix of sugar browning and spice smells in light to middle roasting, dried ginger and molasses, a subtle dried cherry accent. The wet aroma has a more intense sweetness that comes off like spiced molasses cookies, characteristics sensed in the dry fragrance gaining potency, and a whisp of florals comes through when breaking through the crust. The cup meets expectations set by the aromatic profile, base brown sugar and molasses flavors build as the cup cools, and baking spice hints offer pleasant contrast.</description>

      <guid>https://frioux.github.io/clog/posts/2018-07-20/</guid>
      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  This Dumerso dry-processed lot is a powerhouse in terms of fruit-forward aromatics. The dry-fragrance has a cornucopia of fruits, raspberry and ripe blueberry, Turkish apricots, grape juice, along with a substantial backdrop of bittersweet burnt sugars. The fruits approach floral dimensions, and a start jasmine note accents the ground coffee. The wet aromatics are equally intense, a representation of blackberry and strawberry toppings, a hint of dried mango, and a cacao-like bittersweetness in our roasts closer to Full City.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Nano Challa has a honey sweet smell in lightest roasts (City), stone fruit and tea suggestions, and sugary sweetness that finds it&amp;rsquo;s apex when adding hot water. Brown sugar and toffee smells are focused in the wet aroma, a candy sweetness that reminds me of torrone (minus the nuts), and the break releases a light accent of pearl jasmine tea, giving way to more weighty fruited smells that have elements of fruit cobbler.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Nansebo has an herbal sweetness like rue, backed with a flavor of white honey in City/City+ roasting that makes for a deliciously sweet Ethiopian cup. Clove spice hints mark the dry fragrance, along with perfumed orange smells in our light roasts. The wet aroma has a canned peach scent that culminates in a likeness of peach pie with graham cracker crust. As a brewed coffee, Nansebo pushes a deep level of honey sweetness at a wide range of roasts, City and City+ roasts striking a nice level of balance between fruited sweetness and a orange-like brightness.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  This Dumerso dry-processed lot is a powerhouse in terms of fruit-forward aromatics. The dry-fragrance has a cornucopia of fruits, raspberry and ripe blueberry, Turkish apricots, grape juice, along with a substantial backdrop of bittersweet burnt sugars. The fruits approach floral dimensions, and a start jasmine note accents the ground coffee. The wet aromatics are equally intense, a representation of blackberry and strawberry toppings, a hint of dried mango, and a cacao-like bittersweetness in our roasts closer to Full City.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Nansebo has an herbal sweetness like rue, backed with a flavor of white honey in City/City+ roasting that makes for a deliciously sweet Ethiopian cup. Clove spice hints mark the dry fragrance, along with perfumed orange smells in our light roasts. The wet aroma has a canned peach scent that culminates in a likeness of peach pie with graham cracker crust. As a brewed coffee, Nansebo pushes a deep level of honey sweetness at a wide range of roasts, City and City+ roasts striking a nice level of balance between fruited sweetness and a orange-like brightness.</description>

      <description>Blend  1lb Ethiopia Dry Process Yirga Cheffe Wenago 1&amp;frasl;4 lb Sumatra Aceh-Mandheling  Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Wenago is a nice late season Ethiopia, and anything but subtle: strawberry, raspberry, red apple, stone fruit, fading to sweet tobacco and aromatic wood notes in the long finish. (and above)
 Very little stone flavors. Fairly bland. Maybe this isn&amp;rsquo;t good for cold brew? ☹</description>
