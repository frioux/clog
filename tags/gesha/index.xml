      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  La Tacita Floral proves that when it comes to espresso, a little Gesha cultivar goes a long way. To be fair, 1&amp;frasl;3 is no small amount, and from the high level of floral flavor and aroma found in the shot, I&amp;rsquo;d believe it if I were told this was 100% Gesha cultivar. We roasted several batches of this blend, and some of my favorites were on the lighter end of the roast spectrum, but with stretched roast times.</description>

      <title>Guatemala Acatenango Gesha Lot #227</title>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s [wbm]  This Gesha lot makes for an interesting brew to say the least, tea notes proliferate in both aroma and cup flavors, from pearl jasmine to Assam teas. The cup is both floral and brisk, a flavor combo not necessarily unique to Gesha cultivar, but certainly unique to most Latin American coffees. An herbal sweetness marks the aroma, as do licorice tea, and a palm sugar scent as you near Full City.</description>
