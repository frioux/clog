      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  The cup is both floral and brisk, a flavor combo not necessarily unique to Gesha cultivar, but certainly unique to most Latin American coffees. The dry fragrance might lead you to believe otherwise showing more of a cinnamon/sugar combination that is still alluring, but not the perfumed smell I expected. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until breaking through the wetted crust that I uncovered attractive jasmine flower aromatics, along with wafts of honey and tea.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s [wbm]  This Gesha lot makes for an interesting brew to say the least, tea notes proliferate in both aroma and cup flavors, from pearl jasmine to Assam teas. The cup is both floral and brisk, a flavor combo not necessarily unique to Gesha cultivar, but certainly unique to most Latin American coffees. An herbal sweetness marks the aroma, as do licorice tea, and a palm sugar scent as you near Full City.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Ethiopia Sidama Nansebo Ethiopia Gera Jimma Nano Challa Coop Guatemala Xinabajul San Pedro Necta Costa Rica Helsar Santa Lucia  Cupping Note: this coffee was ground fine instead of coarse by mistake and thus it is pretty notably distinct in flavor than it would be otherwise.
Acidity: Not especially acidic
Sweetness: canned peach sweetness
Mouthfeel: Very oily
Flavor: Bizarrely, this tastes like prune babyfood to me.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  The dry fragrance of San Pedro Necta has nice sweet smelling dry fragrance, allusions to ginger snap cookies at City roast level with a mix of dark sugar and subtle spice notes, and Full City roasts shift to strong bittersweetness that is accompanied by wafts of raisin and cola. There&amp;rsquo;s a nice range of smells here, and adding hot water ushers in more roasted nut type smells in the light roast, whereas bittersweetness remains resolute at Full City, and breaking through the crust gives off an incredible smell of dark chocolate with dried fruit accents.</description>
