      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s (wbm)  Thageini has a big berry-like fragrance coming out of the grinder, red raspberry and aromatic sugar notes builiding out a sweet smelling profile. This perfumed mix continues into the wet aroma, smells of fruits cooked with molasses sugars coming off the steaming coffee crust, and a baking spice note accenting the steam. Berry and unrefined sugar notes are the first flavors that come to mind when sipping the hot cup, like red berry cooked down to a sugary pastry filling, along with an orange rind note that adds a tartness to the profile.</description>
