      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  The sweetness smelled in the dry fragrance has the pungency of black strap molasses with peppery tobacco accents. Both City+ and Full City roasts have potent, rustic sweetness, mixing syrupy fruit smells with earth-toned bittersweetness. The aroma is quite herbal, and a complex mix of bittersweet cocoa and green herbals are released on the break. The cup is complex, malt syrups with bell pepper and burdock root accents as it cools.</description>

      <description>Blend  1lb Ethiopia Dry Process Yirga Cheffe Wenago 1&amp;frasl;4 lb Sumatra Aceh-Mandheling  Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Wenago is a nice late season Ethiopia, and anything but subtle: strawberry, raspberry, red apple, stone fruit, fading to sweet tobacco and aromatic wood notes in the long finish. (and above)
 Very little stone flavors. Fairly bland. Maybe this isn&amp;rsquo;t good for cold brew? â˜¹</description>

      <description>Roasted differently than normal; dropped heat gun to low during first crack. I think that this underroasted the beans just a little. Coffee is still good but in addition to last week&amp;rsquo;s notes it tastes a little green.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s:  Brooding dark cacao notes, pulpy fruit, dried banana, lingonberry, mossy, forest floor-type earthiness, herbacious
 Very rich and strong; Agree re mossy, forest floor, and herbacious. Prefer FC+ to French.
This may grow on me, but as it stands this coffee is really not my style</description>
