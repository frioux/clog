      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s ([wbm])  This is a very unique flavor profile. From the dry grounds, berry and spice notes are clear, as well as malt sugars and honey. My lightest roasts have a graham cracker wet aroma, with a lemon bar like smell as well. City+ level has more honey sweetness, prominent berry tones, and sweet spice notes of ginger, and herbs. A floral jasmine tea note and spice accents come through clearly in the cup, and vibrant citrus weaves through it all.</description>
