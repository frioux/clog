      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s (wbm)  Delicious and delicate, this wet processed lot from Hambela Hassan is as sweet as it is floral, complex top notes burgeoning from the cups of light and middle roasts, and vibrant acidity helps construct a dynamic cup. The dry fragrance has perfumed florals, with a smell of peaches and cream, and a soft hint of vanilla. The wetted grounds of City roasts extend an aroma of peach, apricot, and nectarine, fruited smells with the volume of a natural process coffee, but more tea-like, and delicate in nature.</description>
