      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Nano Challa has a honey sweet smell in lightest roasts (City), stone fruit and tea suggestions, and sugary sweetness that finds it&amp;rsquo;s apex when adding hot water. Brown sugar and toffee smells are focused in the wet aroma, a candy sweetness that reminds me of torrone (minus the nuts), and the break releases a light accent of pearl jasmine tea, giving way to more weighty fruited smells that have elements of fruit cobbler.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Ethiopia Sidama Nansebo Ethiopia Gera Jimma Nano Challa Coop Guatemala Xinabajul San Pedro Necta Costa Rica Helsar Santa Lucia  Cupping Note: this coffee was ground fine instead of coarse by mistake and thus it is pretty notably distinct in flavor than it would be otherwise.
Acidity: Not especially acidic
Sweetness: canned peach sweetness
Mouthfeel: Very oily
Flavor: Bizarrely, this tastes like prune babyfood to me.</description>
