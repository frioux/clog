      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Cupping a City+ roast of Santa Lucia, the ground coffee brings a subtle sweetness to the table, bittering core coffee characteristics present with a layer of unrefined sugar sweetness mixed in. The coffee makes quite a transformation from this humble start, wet aromatics giving promise of a bigger coffee than the fragrance lets on to. A coconut and dark chocolate smell comes up in the steam, along with fruited accents that are still a little on the dull side, but their presence is definite.</description>

      <title>Brazil Santa Lucia Yellow Bourbon</title>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  City+ to Vienna: Big body, low acidity, sweet to savory notes, brown sugar, almond paste, walnut, peanut cookie, cocoa powder.
 Acidity: Minimal
Sweetness: None
Mouthfeel: Slightly astringent
Flavor: I taste the peanut cookie somewhat and definitely the cocoa powder.
Finish: This coffee has a finish I wish I had a name for; it reminds me of cheap coffee grounds.
Balance: I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t buy this coffee again and I think that savory is likely something to warn me off of a coffee in general.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  City+ to Vienna: Big body, low acidity, sweet to savory notes, brown sugar, almond paste, walnut, peanut cookie, cocoa powder.
 Acidity: I don&amp;rsquo;t get an acidity out of this.
Sweetness: Just a touch of sweetness.
Mouthfeel: Slightly astringent.
Flavor: I can taste the savory notes here. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan but it is definitely distinctive.
Finish: Finish seems stronger or more flavorful than the initial taste, which is unusual and something that I typically dislike.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  City+ to Vienna: Big body, low acidity, sweet to savory notes, brown sugar, almond paste, walnut, peanut cookie, cocoa powder.
 Acidity: Much brighter than the coffee I was drinking last week, which was brewed AeroPress. I&amp;rsquo;m surprised because this is cold brew.
Sweetness: Very, very faint sweetness that I sometimes suspect is a mirage caused by the low temperature of the coffee.
Mouthfeel: Slightly tannic. Not as oily as I&amp;rsquo;d hope for.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  City+ to Vienna: Big body, low acidity, sweet to savory notes, brown sugar, almond paste, walnut, peanut cookie, cocoa powder.
 Acidity: Little to none.
Sweetness: Little to none
Mouthfeel: Very thin.
Flavor: I do think I taste some of the nutty flavors alluded to in the SM review.
Finish: Having trouble grokking the finish right now.
Overall I think this isn&amp;rsquo;t great. Maybe it will grow on me through the week but it&amp;rsquo;s not what I&amp;rsquo;m usually looking for.</description>
