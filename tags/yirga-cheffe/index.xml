      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  The dry fragrance has a mix of sugar browning and spice smells in light to middle roasting, dried ginger and molasses, a subtle dried cherry accent. The wet aroma has a more intense sweetness that comes off like spiced molasses cookies, characteristics sensed in the dry fragrance gaining potency, and a whisp of florals comes through when breaking through the crust. The cup meets expectations set by the aromatic profile, base brown sugar and molasses flavors build as the cup cools, and baking spice hints offer pleasant contrast.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  This Dumerso dry-processed lot is a powerhouse in terms of fruit-forward aromatics. The dry-fragrance has a cornucopia of fruits, raspberry and ripe blueberry, Turkish apricots, grape juice, along with a substantial backdrop of bittersweet burnt sugars. The fruits approach floral dimensions, and a start jasmine note accents the ground coffee. The wet aromatics are equally intense, a representation of blackberry and strawberry toppings, a hint of dried mango, and a cacao-like bittersweetness in our roasts closer to Full City.</description>

      <description>Blend  1lb Ethiopia Dry Process Yirga Cheffe Wenago 1&amp;frasl;4 lb Sumatra Aceh-Mandheling  Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Wenago is a nice late season Ethiopia, and anything but subtle: strawberry, raspberry, red apple, stone fruit, fading to sweet tobacco and aromatic wood notes in the long finish. (and above)
 Very little stone flavors. Fairly bland. Maybe this isn&amp;rsquo;t good for cold brew? â˜¹</description>
