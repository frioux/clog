## [Sweet Maria's][sm]

 > The dry fragrance has a mix of sugar browning and spice smells in light to
 > middle roasting, dried ginger and molasses, a subtle dried cherry accent.
 > The wet aroma has a more intense sweetness that comes off like spiced
 > molasses cookies, characteristics sensed in the dry fragrance gaining
 > potency, and a whisp of florals comes through when breaking through the
 > crust. The cup meets expectations set by the aromatic profile, base brown
 > sugar and molasses flavors build as the cup cools, and baking spice hints
 > offer pleasant contrast. Florals are very subtle, and most notable when
 > drinking a hot cup. When the cup cools down the floral aromatic note fades,
 > leaving behind a flavor compound build on sugar browning sweetness, with
 > raisin and cinnamon spice accents, as well as a cane juice note in the
 > finish. There's a lemon rind like brightness that's on the mild side for
 > Ethiopia, and with a fairly weighty body, this coffee from Woreda Wonago
 > doubles well as a sweet single origin espresso.
