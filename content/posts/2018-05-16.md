> Cupping a City+ roast of Santa Lucia, the ground coffee brings a subtle
> sweetness to the table, bittering core coffee characteristics present with a
> layer of unrefined sugar sweetness mixed in. The coffee makes quite a
> transformation from this humble start, wet aromatics giving promise of a
> bigger coffee than the fragrance lets on to. A coconut and dark chocolate
> smell comes up in the steam, along with fruited accents that are still a
> little on the dull side, but their presence is definite. And the brewed coffee
> gives the final show, a sweet undercurrent of toffee and honey flavors,
> offsetting central bittersweetness. There's life breathed into the fruited
> tones sensed early on in aroma, and they take form as accents of dried peach,
> whole dried banana, and coconut chips. Santa Lucia has lovely apple/malic
> acidic impression at this roast level too, which adds definition to the
> flavors in the cup profile. Body is noticeably juicy too, and I think taking a
> shade darker (Full City) will yield dense bittersweetness and viscous
> mouthfeel, not to mention make a good option for Costa Rican single origin
> espresso.
