## Sweet Maria's

> City+ to Vienna: Big body, low acidity, sweet to savory notes, brown sugar,
> almond paste, walnut, peanut cookie, cocoa powder.

Acidity: I don't get an acidity out of this.

Sweetness: Just a touch of sweetness.

Mouthfeel: Slightly astringent.

Flavor: I can taste the savory notes here.  I'm not sure I'm a big fan but it is
definitely distinctive.

Finish: Finish seems stronger or more flavorful than the initial taste, which is
unusual and something that I typically dislike.

Balance: This coffee is ok.  I don't think I'd order it again though.
