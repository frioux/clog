> This Gesha lot makes for an interesting brew to say the least, tea notes
> proliferate in both aroma and cup flavors, from pearl jasmine to Assam teas.
> The cup is both floral and brisk, a flavor combo not necessarily unique to
> Gesha cultivar, but certainly unique to most Latin American coffees. An herbal
> sweetness marks the aroma, as do licorice tea, and a palm sugar scent as you
> near Full City. This coffee shows exceptionally well in light to middle
> roasts, layers of raw sugar sweetness providing a nice backdrop for
> contrasting floral hints, and herbaceous tea notes like Earl Grey and
> Darjeeling to stand out against. As the cup cools, sweetness builds in
> strength, and what starts out as unrefined sugar flavor like demurara, ends up
> more in line with the mild molasses flavor of date sugar. The cup has moderate
> acidity that comes off very tea-like, but with a citrus element as well (think
> black tea with lemon spritz).  And while I don't recommend Full City roasts
> for brew, as most of the floral and tea notes will be compromised, it makes
> for a chocolate-y and floral espresso. A sweet toffee taste is underscored by
> fine, bittersweet cacao bar, and these shots produce incredibly thick body
> that weighs heavy on the palate.

## Roast Notes

It was pretty cold but not windy, so covering the roaster worked pretty well.
