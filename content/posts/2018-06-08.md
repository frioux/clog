> Nano Challa has a honey sweet smell in lightest roasts (City), stone fruit and
> tea suggestions, and sugary sweetness that finds it's apex when adding hot
> water. Brown sugar and toffee smells are focused in the wet aroma, a candy
> sweetness that reminds me of torrone (minus the nuts), and the break releases
> a light accent of pearl jasmine tea, giving way to more weighty fruited smells
> that have elements of fruit cobbler. Brewed, Nano Challa produces a lightly
> fruited cup at City and City+ roast levels, with refined sweetness, and
> pristine finish. The underlying flavor is reminiscent of white honey, which is
> mildly fruited in flavor, and an aromatic note of ginger chew candies. Lighter
> roasts have a mild citrus note like orange juice, pulp and all, along with
> subtle Earl Grey and Jasmine accents. Darker fruit tones are built up at
> deeper roast levels, along with a Ricola-like dark herbal aspect, and the
> finish is marked by pleasant bittering qualities  of cacao and dried orange
> peel. A mild citrus-like acdity serves as a focal point too, especially in the
> lighter roasts, adding a mouthcleansing affect to the finish. This years' Nano
> Challa has a dense mouthfeel, especially in middle to dark roasting, making
> for a nice choice for espresso blend accent coffee. 

**Note**: this also was about 20% [Illubabor](/clog/tags/illubabor) because I
ran out of the main coffee.

## Roast Notes

I spilled some of the beans so the weight loss might be a little off.

## Cupping

Acidity: Very muted acidityâ€” well integrated with flavor

Sweetness: Bright sweetness that I'd call citrus.

Mouthfeel: Rich and slightly oily

Flavor: Citric and candylike.

Finish: Somewhat dull but inoffensive.

Balance: Fine.
