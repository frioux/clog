> The dry fragrance has a spiced grape smell, with a subtle citrus feature
> wrapped in maple sugar sweetness. Aromatically too, I picked up on a smell of
> citrus, more like dried/candied lemon peel, and with sweet layers of sugar
> browning smells. The cup of City roasts most echoes the notes on aroma, and
> you won't be disappointed if light roasting is your preference. A soft
> lemonade note comes through along with a floral orange tea accent, and acidity
> has a slight grabbiness to it, akin to pink grapefruit. Berry notes accent the
> cup as well, but don't really come through in City roasts, at least in
> comparison to a City+ or even Full City roast. It's kind of surprising how
> just a shade darker reveals a whole other coffee. Fruit and sugar tones come
> off like blackberry pancake syrup, and jammy fruit filling sandwiched between
> layers of dark chocolate. No matter where you wind up on the City to Full City
> spectrum, a lasting sweetness prevails. Complexity will shine in pour over
> brewing, and even full submersion brews such as French Press.
