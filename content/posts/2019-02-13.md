> Thageini has a big berry-like fragrance coming out of the grinder, red
> raspberry and aromatic sugar notes builiding out a sweet smelling profile.
> This perfumed mix continues into the wet aroma, smells of fruits cooked with
> molasses sugars coming off the steaming coffee crust, and a baking spice note
> accenting the steam. Berry and unrefined sugar notes are the first flavors
> that come to mind when sipping the hot cup, like red berry cooked down to a
> sugary pastry filling, along with an orange rind note that adds a tartness to
> the profile. The cool brew further reinforces a fruit and raw sugar centered
> cup profile, and a spice note hints at cinnamon powder in the finish. Acidity
> is brightest in light roasts, tart citric aspects offering a contrasting, and
> somewhat rind-y vibrance. Don't take this coffee beyond Full City as the
> sweet, fruited flavors will be compromised. At Full City, however, dark
> blueberry and raspberry flavors are powerful, and the brightness that is found
> in lighter roasts is much more muted. This works in favor of single origin
> Kenyan espresso, no puckering acidity to take away from the delicous dark
> berry fruit flavors that make their way into the shot.
