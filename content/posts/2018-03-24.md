> The dry fragrance of San Pedro Necta has nice sweet smelling dry fragrance,

> smells here, and adding hot water ushers in more roasted nut type smells in
> the light roast, whereas bittersweetness remains resolute at Full City, and
> breaking through the crust gives off an incredible smell of dark chocolate
> with dried fruit accents. As a cup, my City+ roast San Pedro Necta showcased
> flavors of toasted muscovado sugar and roasted almond, vanilla and cinnamon
> powder accents in the finish. Acidity is on the 'slight' side, but still
> offers a soft structure ala Red Delicious apples. There's a chocolate
> undertone too that flourishes when you reach Full City roast level. A nice,
> rich flavor of fine Dutch drinking cocoa comes through in darker roasts and
> hangs on long after the final sip. This is a great drinking coffee, and one
> that fits the daily drinker roster - sweet, balanced, bodied, and without any
> 'over the top', top notes. San Pedro Necta also makes a great dual-use coffee
> with SO espresso shots displaying rich chocolate tones and inky mouthfeel in
> the Full City roast range.
