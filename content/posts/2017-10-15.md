## Sweet Maria's

> City+ to Vienna: Big body, low acidity, sweet to savory notes, brown sugar,
> almond paste, walnut, peanut cookie, cocoa powder.

Acidity: Much brighter than the coffee I was drinking last week, which was
brewed AeroPress.  I'm surprised because this is cold brew.

Sweetness: Very, very faint sweetness that I sometimes suspect is a mirage
caused by the low temperature of the coffee.

Mouthfeel: Slightly tannic.  Not as oily as I'd hope for.

Flavor: Spartan.  Not a ton of flavor here but what is there is good.

Finish: Likely related to the minimal flavor, I think the best term for this
finish is clean."  There could be more, but at least what is there is not bad.

Balance: "Not bad."
