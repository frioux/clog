> This Dumerso dry-processed lot is a powerhouse in terms of fruit-forward
> aromatics. The dry-fragrance has a cornucopia of fruits, raspberry and ripe
> blueberry, Turkish apricots, grape juice, along with a substantial backdrop of
> bittersweet burnt sugars. The fruits approach floral dimensions, and a start
> jasmine note accents the ground coffee. The wet aromatics are equally intense,
> a representation of blackberry and strawberry toppings, a hint of dried mango,
> and a cacao-like bittersweetness in our roasts closer to Full City. The cup is
> predictably, loaded with fruit flavors, an uncompromising array of ripe and
> dry fruited notes that roasts north of 2nd snaps do little to tame. From
> tropical to temperate, fruits like strawberry, ripe blueberry, fruit lambic,
> jack fruit, and pineapple build as the cup temperature cools, and a mixed
> berry jam note lingers in the aftertaste. We found City roasts to have a
> citric quality too, like orange rind, a tartness that gives off acidic
> impression adding structure to the complex range of flavor notes. An
> impressive jasmine grace note shows clearly at a fairly wide roast range,
> adding to the complex layers of flavor. Full City roasts boast thick body,
> sticky fruit flavors, and a healthy backing of high % cacao bar. This coffee
> sits very heavy on the palate and keeps delivering through the long
> aftertaste.
