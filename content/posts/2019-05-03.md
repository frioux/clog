 > The sweetness smelled in the dry fragrance has the pungency of black strap
 > molasses with peppery tobacco accents. Both City+ and Full City roasts have
 > potent, rustic sweetness, mixing syrupy fruit smells with earth-toned
 > bittersweetness. The aroma is quite herbal, and a complex mix of bittersweet
 > cocoa and green herbals are released on the break. The cup is complex, malt
 > syrups with bell pepper and burdock root accents as it cools. A note of dried
 > natural apricot comes up as you move through the cup, along with intense
 > bittersweet chocolate, and a rustic date sugar accent in the finish. Full
 > City roasts are brimming with bittering cacao/unsweetened chocolate flavors,
 > and as the coffee cools, top notes like pipe tobacco, green pepper, peat, and
 > hickory smoke come through in the finish. This coffeeâ€™s body is thick, so
 > viscous and syrupy. Add to this a muted acidity level, and you have the
 > makings for a wonderful espresso blend component, or even single origin. This
 > is a Sumatra that shows well in light roasting, even at City roast, however
 > my favorite brewed cup was in the City+ to Full City roast range, where earth
 > tones find balance among rustic syrupy sweetness. I also prefer letting this
 > coffee rest for a couple days before drinking, allowing the flavor notes to
 > coalesce
