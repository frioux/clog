> This is a very unique flavor profile. From the dry grounds, berry and spice
> notes are clear, as well as malt sugars and honey. My lightest roasts have a
> graham cracker wet aroma, with a lemon bar like  smell as well. City+ level
> has more honey sweetness, prominent berry tones, and sweet spice notes of
> ginger, and herbs. A floral jasmine tea note and spice accents come through
> clearly in the cup, and vibrant citrus weaves through it all. Lemony acidity,
> and citrus flavor notes provide a high toned piquant character for this
> coffee, particularly in the lighter roast levels. As the cup cools, sweet
> spice and lemon come up, coalescing as ginger-spiced lemonade, and the
> crowning floral note lingers in the aftertaste. My City+ roast had more of a
> berry-focused cup profile, with tart blueberry skin, and grape flavors, subtle
> wine-like fruit accents, and citrus acidic impression still shining bright.
> The body is fairly light and increases as the cup cools, with a waxy mouthfeel
> and a suggestion of walnut oil. This isn't an agressive coffee, but rather a
> very aromatic, delicate, and distinct cup.
