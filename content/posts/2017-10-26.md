> The smells in the dry grounds of Riakiberu are attractive, City+ roasts offering
> a mix of malty sweetness, and berry jelly. Fruits are present without
> overpowering the aroma, and while smells of baked goods, caramelizing sugars,
> and such billow in the steam from the hot coffee, subtler accent notes like
> berry and melon compliment this sugary base. Riakiberu brews really well, City+
> roasts promising flavors of sagarcane juice, cantelope, and an interesting
> herbal note of celery soda. There's a honey-wheat flavor too that comes through
> in the finish that while a little odd for Kenya, but is just an afterthought as
> you pass through flavors of fruit tea, tart limeade, and lemon-rhubarb. Acidity
> is bright from the get go, the perception of citrus is apparent, and we noticed
> that the citric overtones gain momentum as the cup temperature cools. There's a
> tannic aspect in the finish that's similar to slightly over extracted black tea,
> and flavors of unrefined sweeteners like barley malt and rice syrup round out
> the finish.
