 > Peach and lime smells are released in the dry fragrance, a dried stone fruit
 > sweetness and with zesty lime peel accents. Gidhey shows layered raw sugar
 > sweetness in the ground coffee and wet aroma, warmed caramel-y smells
 > released in the steam that have elements of caramelizing dark brown sugars,
 > panela, sucanat, and more. City roasts are the most floral, a fresh aroma of
 > gardenia flower coming through in the brewed coffee, along with a clean and
 > sweet impression of simple syrup sweetener. A lemon note lightly graces the
 > cup of light roasts too, providing a solidness in structure to an otherwise
 > rather delicate cup (these light roasts remind me of a delicate Yirga
 > Cheffe). The cooling cup reveals more fruited accents, pomelo tartness, peach
 > tea, along with a sweet flame grape note. The finish is pointed if not short,
 > and muted flavors of vanilla and powdered sugar come through in the finish,
 > and reminds me of biscochitios (often referred to as Mexican wedding
 > cookies). The perfumed qualities of Gidhey show best with light roasting, and
 > I recommend a rather tight roast range of City to City+.
