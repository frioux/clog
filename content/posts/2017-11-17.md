> Nansebo has an herbal sweetness like rue, backed with a flavor of white honey
> in City/City+ roasting that makes for a deliciously sweet Ethiopian cup. Clove
> spice hints mark the dry fragrance, along with perfumed orange smells in our
> light roasts. The wet aroma has a canned peach scent that culminates in a
> likeness of peach pie with graham cracker crust. As a brewed coffee, Nansebo
> pushes a deep level of honey sweetness at a wide range of roasts, City and
> City+ roasts striking a nice level of balance between fruited sweetness and a
> orange-like brightness. The cooling cup offers glimpses of stone fruit and
> citrus notes too, tart apricot, nectarine, and a slightly underripe orange
> flavor register. There's a contrasting, pleasant bittering sensation too that
> reminds me of peach skins too, sweet-to-tart flavors rounding out the long
> finish. Full City roast bear some darker fruited notes, plum and prune juice,
> but in low volume comparatively to core bittersweetness of honey-backed cocoa
> powder. Acidity is more muted at Full City too, and I found ours to make
> incredible single origin espresso. Espresso shots have focuesed fruited notes,
> blueberry and dark chocolate, tenedam spice, fresh coriander, and a nice
> citrus zing.
