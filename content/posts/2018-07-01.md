## Roast Notes

This is the first time I've roasted peaberry or Sumatran coffee.  It was bizarre
to me how long it took to get to first crack.  I would have assumed peaberry
would roast faster, not slower.

## Cupping

Caveat lector: This is the first time I've had Peruvian coffee and so I am
caught somewhat flatfooted tasting it.

Acidity: Up front acidity that reminds me more of limes than many other fruits,
but not quite as tart.

Sweetness: There's a weird sweetness I can't place.  The SM notes say apricot,
and maybe that's it?

Mouthfeel: Rich and thick.

Flavor: This coffee is so rich.  To me it has a super condensed flavor that I
would call punchy.

Finish: Pleasant!  I taste the bell pepper here.

Balance: Good.  We'll have to see if it grows on me or not over time.
