 > This Matalapa lot is an approachable cup, balanced core coffee flavors, and
 > infinitely drinkable. The dry fragrance from the ground coffee has hazelnuts
 > and honey granola scents, while the wet aromatics give a more volatile
 > aromatic emphasis to the dry fragrance, praline, almonds and a hint of dried
 > fruit. The cup flavors add to this a unique green tea accent at City+ roast,
 > with the cup dominated by layered caramel and nutty roast tones, and a twist
 > of orange rind in the finish. Body is moderate at this level, and at Full
 > City seems much more dense and opaque, as do the accompanying bittersweet
 > cocoa roast tones. It has mild acidity, and at City+ finds balance between
 > brightness, flavor and body. Finca Matalapa makes for a classic-toned SO
 > espresso at Full City roast, heavy cocoa roast flavor is accented by an
 > orange zest note, and followed by creamy macadamia nut in the aftertaste.
