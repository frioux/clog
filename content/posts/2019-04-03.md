> We bought two lots from Tome, one wet processed, and this dry processed.
> They're both beautiful cups, and a side by side comparison shows just how much
> processing influences the cup. This DP is so fruit forward in comparison,
> strong dried and fresh fruit flavors, and sweetness with matched intensity. At
> City and City+ roast levels, the smells from the ground and wetted coffee are
> pretty incredible, peach, mango, molasses, raisiny dried fruit, and even
> subtle floral highllights. Closer to Full City brings about equalizing
> bittersweetness, but not without a high level of cooked fruit smells too. A
> brewed City roast highlights floral notes in Tome, a flavor of floral berry,
> blueberry, blackberry coming to mind. Fruit flavor notes are juicy, and
> candied in the lighter roasts, reminding me of aspects of stone fruit and
> papaya nectars, and berry flavored bubble gum. These heavier handed flavor
> tones are contrasted by delicate accent notes of hibiscus tea and rose petal
> florals when the coffee cools, that all together construct a complex flavor
> portrait. A cooled cup expresses some citrus and bittersweet cocoa notes as
> well, which a friend I was tasting with described as chocolate-covered,
> dehydrated orange slices. If you're a fan of fruit-forward naturals, you'll be
> amazed at all that Tome has to offer. Best to steer clear of 2nd snaps in
> order to enjoy what's special about this coffee.
