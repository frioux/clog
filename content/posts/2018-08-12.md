 > The ground coffee has a clean scent of brown sugar and hazelnut, sort of a
 > butter/shortbread cookie smell. The addition of hot water pulls out sugar
 > browning sweetness, toffee nut smells, candied roasted almonds. Light roasts
 > have soft lemon acidity that's really a nice feature, a mellow tartness that
 > emerges amidst unrefined sugar and raw nut flavors like Brazil nut and
 > hazelnut. It adds a mouth cleansing affect in the finish too, which lends to
 > the perception of a clean finish. My roast that was just shy of Full City
 > developed a tasty milk chocolate flavor, the cooled cup showing a muted
 > raisin note too, like chocolate covered raisin. A clean and mild Peruvian
 > cup.
