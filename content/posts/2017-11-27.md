> This Pacamara lot from Alpina has such an interesting herbal sweetness in the
> cup. City and City+ roasts have flavors of sweet basil and celery soda, and an
> delightful green floral accent note. The fragrance and aroma smell complex,
> floral tea and sweet herbaceous notes permeate from the coffee, and the
> impressions I get are reminiscent of Maracaturra coffees, the large bean
> hybrid of Maragoype and Caturra that is popular in Nicaragua. This coffee
> excels as a pour over brew, with well articulated flavor notes discernible in
> the cup. Acidity is brilliant in light roasts, like tangy citrus, a vibrance
> that holds up as the coffee cools. The level of sweetness is moderate, and
> transparent like simple syrup sugar, lending sweetness without the added
> molasses flavors that come with sugar in the raw.
