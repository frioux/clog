## Sweet Maria's

(From Google Cache:)

> The dry fragrance of Juanambú has a butter toffee nut smell to it, City and
> City+ roasts offer caramel/toffee overtones, with roasted almond and black
> walnut smells underneath. The level of sweetness is prominent in the wet
> aroma, a scent of fresh baked cinnamon rolls with white icing, and a strong
> note of caramelizing sugars. The cup has raw sugar sweetness that comes off in
> layers; dark brown sugar, vanilla caramels, malt syrup, and honeyed hints. At
> City there is a lemon vibrance that intensifies as the cup cools, tart, and
> tea-like, and subtle fruited notes of golden raisin and date pieces pop up.
> The finish is sweet in the short run, shifting to a long bittersweet end. This
> bittersweetness is more dominant in Full City roasts, but the sweet side of
> this equation is really hard to beat, let alone eclipse. I loved the
> brightness and fruit notes captured in our light roasts, but this is also a
> great option for those looking for coffees suited for 2nd snaps. Juanambú is
> made up of really dense beans (as a result of cultivar and altitude) that can
> handle high heat without issue.
