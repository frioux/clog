> The dry fragrance has a cooked brown sugar smell, rounded and sweet, and with
> whiffs of slab apricot and other dried fruits. The aroma has a clean raw sugar
> sweet smell and breaking through the crust releases more delicate floral and
> fruit notes. What a great cup; clean fruited flavors, zesty but not too
> bright, refreshing and mouth cleansing. At City roast level the coffee's
> sweetness is much more refined than the fragrance would leave you to believe,
> like simple syrup and white table sugar, and a tart lemon note is a cup
> highlight. Floral notes bring an elegant touch to the cup profile, perfumed
> lilac and jasmine notes adding a complex overlay. The cooling coffee sees
> fresh fruited notes hinting at flame grape and Meyer lemon at City roast, and
> a plump blueberry note in more developed roasts as well. I recommend sticking
> to the lighter end of the roast spectrum, partly because of Hana Asrat
> Tilhun's light body which doesn't bode well for propping up smokey roast tones
> in my opinion.
