## Sweet Maria's

> City and City+ roasting produce a fresh smelling coffee, sweet honey and
> simple syrup allusions are quite attractive in the ground coffee and a
> fragrant floral nectar note contrasts nicely. The wet aroma is delicate but
> with floral intensity. Honeysuckle and freesia florals are perfumed and
> complex and honey sweetness builds in the steam coming off the coffee. Light
> roasts are really where it's at with this coffee, constructing a "light and
> bright" cup that brings to mind the floral and tea-like qualities of what we
> think of as archetypal characteristics of coffee from the Yirga Cheffe region.
> Star jasmine and honeysuckle flowers come to mind when working through the
> coffee, a fragrant highlight that triggers a retronasal response. The cup
> shows abundant sweetness too in light roasts that when hot has the
> transparency of simple syrup or table sugar, shifting to more fragrant honey
> as the coffee cools off a bit. Don't take this one beyond City+. Body is on
> the thin side, which lends to the delicate nature of the cup characteristics
> found on the lighter end of the spectrum.
