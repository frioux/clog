## Sweet Maria's

> Light roasts of Yukiro have tart fruit and delicate floral notes, citrus-like
> acidic impressions as bright as any Ethiopia we've had so far this year. City
> roasts are where the most clarity in cup flavors are acheived, citric to
> tannic acidity propping up the complex nature of the coffee. The fragrance and
> aroma smell of honey and raw sugar, and a scent of black tea is accented by a
> hint of lemon. The aroma is as sweet as the smell of fresh baked ginger snaps,
> sugar browning and subtle spice intimations highlighting the steam. A pour
> over of City roasts yield perfumed retronasal aromatics, especially once
> cooled. A lilac floral note graces the cup, along with citrus accent notes
> such as sweet lime, orange, and pink grapefruit. The coffee flavors are clean
> and clear, uncompromised by much in the way of typical bittering coffee tones.
> The sweetness is like simple syrup, or table sugar, sweetening the cup without
> drawing your attention away from this coffee's inherent vibrance. Our City+
> roast delivered a mild dried peach note, caramel sweetness, and orange rind in
> the aftertaste. Yukiro shows best when roasted light and bright, and makes a
> fantastic pour over brew option.
