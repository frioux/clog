> Delicious and delicate, this wet processed lot from Hambela Hassan is as sweet
> as it is floral, complex top notes burgeoning from the cups of light and
> middle roasts, and vibrant acidity helps construct a dynamic cup. The dry
> fragrance has perfumed florals, with a smell of peaches and cream, and a soft
> hint of vanilla. The wetted grounds of City roasts extend an aroma of peach,
> apricot, and nectarine, fruited smells with the volume of a natural process
> coffee, but more tea-like, and delicate in nature. City roasting is where it's
> at for me, a lovely cup profile built from notes of stone fruit and citrus,
> and easily discernible jasmine floral accents. The hot cup has apricot and
> Assam tea flavors, crystal clear sweetness, and with a very low bittering
> coffee tone underneath. As the coffee cools down some, a tangerine note
> presents a tart/sweet aspect that adds structure to the cup, and a layer of
> raw cane juice is experienced from start to finish. Citrus acidity seems to
> grow as you move through the coffee, and fruited flavors shift from
> apricot/nectarine, to tangy orange, pink grapefruit, and more. Hambela Hassan
> has a clean finish, and a flavor of English Breakfast tea highlights the long
> aftertaste. I did try a Full City roast too, but found that smokey roast tones
> detracted from the complexity found a couple shades lighter.
