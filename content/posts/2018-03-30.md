> Nano Challa has a honey sweet smell in lightest roasts (City), stone fruit and
> tea suggestions, and sugary sweetness that finds it's apex when adding hot
> water. Brown sugar and toffee smells are focused in the wet aroma, a candy
> sweetness that reminds me of torrone (minus the nuts), and the break releases
> a light accent of pearl jasmine tea, giving way to more weighty fruited smells
> that have elements of fruit cobbler. Brewed, Nano Challa produces a lightly
> fruited cup at City and City+ roast levels, with refined sweetness, and
> pristine finish. The underlying flavor is reminiscent of white honey, which is
> mildly fruited in flavor, and an aromatic note of ginger chew candies. Lighter
> roasts have a mild citrus note like orange juice, pulp and all, along with
> subtle Earl Grey and Jasmine accents. Darker fruit tones are built up at
> deeper roast levels, along with a Ricola-like dark herbal aspect, and the
> finish is marked by pleasant bittering qualities  of cacao and dried orange
> peel. A mild citrus-like acdity serves as a focal point too, especially in the
> lighter roasts, adding a mouthcleansing affect to the finish. This years' Nano
> Challa has a dense mouthfeel, especially in middle to dark roasting, making
> for a nice choice for espresso blend accent coffee. 

## Cupping

Acidity: Almost grassy acidity that I hope I learn to love.

Sweetness: Very subtle chocolatey sweetness.

Mouthfeel: Fresh and non-oily.

Flavor: To me this mostly tastes like dark chocolate.  I can just barely taste
the fruit flavors.  Hopefully I'll be able to taste them more tomorrow.

Finish: Light finish with just a hint of bitterness.

Balance: This coffee is fine.  Not amazing.  Hard to compare to other
Ethiopians.
