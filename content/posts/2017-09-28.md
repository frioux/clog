## Sweet Maria's

> City+ to Vienna: Big body, low acidity, sweet to savory notes, brown sugar,
> almond paste, walnut, peanut cookie, cocoa powder.

Acidity: Little to none.

Sweetness:  Little to none

Mouthfeel: Very thin.

Flavor:  I do think I taste some of the nutty flavors alluded to in the SM
review.

Finish: Having trouble grokking the finish right now.

Overall I think this isn't great.  Maybe it will grow on me through the week but
it's not what I'm usually looking for.
