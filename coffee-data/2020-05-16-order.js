City to Full City.","Score":88.1,"URL":"https://www.sweetmarias.com/burundi-dry-process-kayanza-nemba-6426.html","SKU":"GCX-6426","FarmNotes":"Nemba Station is a coffee cherry collection and processing site located in Kayanza, Burundi's northern province that borders neighboring Rwanda. Farmers from surrounding \"collines\", or hill tops, deliver their harvest in whole cherry at the Nemba site, where it is then wet processed and then dried. Kayanza Province itself sits at 1800 meters above sea level, and the farms from the 15 hill tops that serve the Nemba Station top out at over 2000 meters. Farmers grow mostly older bourbon types, the original coffee cultivar introduced to the area in the 1930s by Catholic monks traveling from the island of Reunion. Nemba has been around since the early 1990s, and has won several awards for their coffee, including 1st place in 2015 Cup of Excellence competition and best of Burundi in 2016, no small task. Nemba roasts easily, very little roast color variance as you move from yellowing, to browning, and onto first crack. It helps that the sort is so good, with little to no trace of underripe coffee in the few hundred grams of coffee that we roasted. ","CuppingNotes":"Nemba is an expressive coffee that offers the complexity that only a dry process coffee can deliver. The dry fragrance has a smell of strawberry fruit leather, a sticky, fruited sweetness that's potent to say the least. This is a really clean smelling natural process coffee, the wet aroma showing loads of red berry, cocoa-like smells and something like Strawberry milk powder. The cup has restrained acidity, but the fruited character is quite the opposite. City roasting offers flavors of stewed fruits and rustic sweeteners like palm sugar and brown rice syrup. The fruited flavors are most vivid when the coffee cools down some, but are apparent from the get go. I pick up on aspects of canned plum, mulled berries and fresh baked banana bread. The finish isn't perfect, but the slight papery note you may taste is wiped away by a blueberry accent that lingers in the long finish. At Full City, dark berry notes are buttressed by deep flavors of rustic cocoa, an intoxicating combination. ","Images":["https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/74c1057f7991b4edb2bc7bdaa94de933/r/w/rwanda-cws-nyamasheke-nemba-4.jpg","https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/74c1057f7991b4edb2bc7bdaa94de933/r/w/rwanda-cws-nyamasheke-nemba-2.jpg","https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/74c1057f7991b4edb2bc7bdaa94de933/r/w/rwanda-cws-nyamasheke-nemba-5.jpg"],"AdditionalAttributes":{"Appearance":".4 d/300gr, 16-18 Screen","Arrival date":"February 2020 Arrival","Bag size":"60 KG","Cultivar Detail":"Bourbon","Drying Method":"Raised Bed Sun-Dried","Farm Gate":"Yes","Grade":"A1","Lot size":"50","Packaging":"GrainPro Liner","Processing":"Dry Process (Natural)","Region":"Kayanza Province","Roast Recommendations":"City to Full City","Type":"Farm Gate"}}

This is truly one of the oldest of the micro mills, starting back in 2003, and Hector Bonilla has worked at perfecting production at the facility along with his sons. This particular lot is from La Loma, a farm in Leon Cortes de Tarrazu, also a previous \"top 3\" coffee at Costa Rica COE. La Loma sits between 1750 and 1875 meters, and planted almost entirely in Caturra cultivar. They use a Penagos for mechanically-washing at the station (a version of pulp-natural that closely replicates actual 'wet processing'), efficient water conserving machine, dry parchment on raised beds, and then do all the dry milling themselves. That's part of the beauty of Familia Bonilla/Don Mayo mill, is their ability to oversee the coffee processing from the time it is harvested to the milled green coffee. Like many of the micro-mills, Don Mayo processes coffee from their own farms, as well as buys whole cherry from local farmers to sell as individual micro-lots.","CuppingNotes":"This lot from Don Mayo micro mill has a smell of toasted almonds and a light honey drizzle at City+. The wet aroma pushes a smell of brown sugar in the steam, accented by roasted nut and vanilla bean. The level of sweetness is impressive in the brewed coffee, raw cane sugar and caramel sauce at the center of the cup profile. The brew unfolds to hints of golden raisin and walnut as it cools, along with mid-level acidity that has the intensity of water with a twist of orange. Full City roasts show flavors of sweetened dark chocolate and are sweet as they are bitter. This is a good starting point roast-wise for those interested in single-origin espresso (\"SO\" espresso). Shots have a viscous texture and extract dark flavors of bittersweet chocolate and a piquant citrus note that adds sharp contrast.","Images":["https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/74c1057f7991b4edb2bc7bdaa94de933/c/o/costa-rica-don-mayo-tarrazu-6_2.jpg","https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/74c1057f7991b4edb2bc7bdaa94de933/c/o/costa-rica-don-mayo-tarrazu-4.jpg","https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/74c1057f7991b4edb2bc7bdaa94de933/c/o/costa-rica-don-mayo-tarrazu-15_1.jpg"],"AdditionalAttributes":{"Appearance":".2 d/300gr, 16 - 18 Screen","Arrival date":"July 2019 Arrival","Bag size":"46 KG","Cultivar Detail":"Caturra","Drying Method":"Raised Bed Sun-Dried","Farm Gate":"Yes","Grade":"SHB EP","Lot size":"45","Packaging":"GrainPro Liner","Processing":"Wet Process (Washed)","Recommended for Espresso":"Yes","Region":"San Jose, San Marcos, Tarrazu","Roast Recommendations":"City+ to Full City","Type":"Farm Gate"}}

This is really considered a \"sub-Kebele\", about the smallest geographical division in Ethiopoia. This coffee is a later arrival for us and comes from Guji Highland Farm, a group who manage their own large semi-forest coffee farms around the Guji area. In addition to managing their own estates, they circulate coffee plants to small farmers in the surrounding areas whose coffee they will buy and process at their milling sites. This lot is a blend of coffee from their own farms as well as outgrowers. Coffee is grown at an altitude range of 1900 - 2100+ meters above sea level. The owner of Guji Highland, Wodessa, cooked us an incredible goat dinner when we visited last December and he insisted on putting us up for the night as well. Lucky us, as it was sundown and we were still hours away from our final destination! The bean screen size is pretty broad and there are some very small beans mixed in. If you're roasting on a Behmor, try giving the loaded drum a 'shake' before loading in the machine, allowing for any tiny beans to drop out on your counter rather than in the hot roaster. I'd also recommend Behmor users keep roast batches to 200 grams or less and not go too far into 2nd crack, or at all. The excessive chaff from the dry process coffee can be a fire hazard. All that said, we've had good success with coffee in the Behmor but tend to stick to lighter roasting (better cup in my opinion anyways!). ","CuppingNotes":"Daannisa is a powerhouse dry-process coffee, intense with fruited flavors and bittersweetness, with top notes like baking spice and mild floral aromatics adding to cup complexity. The dry grounds produce smells of dried blueberry and semi-sweet chocolate, a nutmeg hint impacting the fragrance. Berry notes really come up after adding hot water and we picked up on a scent of blackberry pie in the steam, along with chocolate-almond bar and a bit of dried mango. The cup is initially much more bittering when hot and it's the strong cocoa nib notes that are most obvious with some mild fruit and nut accents behind it. But after cooling down a bit, berry flavors really command your attention. The flavors aren't so much like \"fresh\" fruit, but more like dehydrated fruit characteristics, or berries cooked down with raw sugar. Blueberry pie comes to mind in the aftertaste and the long finish is accented by hints of clove and nutmeg spices. The cup flavors are intense and City+ roasting really shines a light on a delicious mixture of fruit and chocolate with a high percentage of cocoa solids.","Images":["https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/74c1057f7991b4edb2bc7bdaa94de933/e/t/ethiopia-wodessa-guji-highland-7.jpg","https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/74c1057f7991b4edb2bc7bdaa94de933/e/t/ethiopia-wodessa-guji-highland-8.jpg","https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/74c1057f7991b4edb2bc7bdaa94de933/e/t/ethiopia-wodessa-guji-highland-11.jpg"],"AdditionalAttributes":{"Appearance":".6 d/300gr, 13-17 Screen - really nice prep for dry process, small seeds make roasting a little difficult (see Farm Notes)","Arrival date":"August 2019 Arrival","Bag size":"60 KG","Cultivar Detail":"Heirloom Cultivars","Drying Method":"Raised Bed Sun-Dried","Farm Gate":"Yes","Grade":"Grade 1","Lot size":"100","Packaging":"GrainPro Liner","Processing":"Dry Process (Natural)","Region":"Suke Quto, Shakiso, Guji Zone","Roast Recommendations":"City to Full City","Type":"Farm Gate"}}

Along with coffee from their own farm called \"Daye Bensa\", they are buying and processing coffee from local farmers from three different growing areas nearby - Shantawene, Bombe and Keramo villages. The samples we tasted from all three sites scored very high and we wound up buying wet and dry process lots from all of them. This lot is a mix of coffees harvested from their own farm and outgrowers around Bombe village. It's certified organic too, which means that they register every farmer who they buy from and certify that organic agricultural practices are being employed at the farm level (they're also Rain Forest Alliance and UTZ certified, but we only brought in with the organic certificate). Ethiopian heirloom types are the main seeds cultivated and altitude ranges from just under 2000 meters to 2100 meters above sea level. It's worth noting that the screen size is on the small side too. The majority of the coffee is 15+, but we are spotting quite a few 14 screen beans in there too. The biggest concern here is that these smaller, lower density beans will roast faster than the largest coffee. While that can be true, we found that either sticking to City to City+ roast range or slowing down the last leg of the roast helps keep the small beans from charring and darker 'roast' flavors at bay.","CuppingNotes":"A clean scent of brown sugar is first to escape from the coffee as you grind it. Bombe is a very sweet Ethiopian coffee, highlighted by fruit and subtle tea-like accent notes. The aromatics seem to have the sweetness of fresh baked gingerbread a City and City+ roast levels, spiced accent notes hinting at candied ginger. My favorite roasts were City and City+, though I did also do a darker, Full City roast. Light roasts have a sweetness that starts off like brown sugar and honey, a syrupy sweetness that holds on in the aftertaste. As the cup cools, fruited accents start to take shape as having characteristics of stone fruits like nectarine and peach. The combination of stone fruit and brown sugar flavors reminds me of some of the Limu coffees we buy, like Nano Challa or Duromina. Bombe doesn't have screaming high acidity either, but with enough of an acidic impression when roasted light, that the profile feels far from limp. My Full City roast had a mix of chocolatey roast tone and some fruited sweetness underneath. Not the cup for me, but it gets my recommendation for espresso. Shots of Bombe have a chocolate-covered dried stone fruit flavor with a twist of lemon up front. A really nice espresso on it's own and would be a crime to cut with milk (or anything else!).","Images":["https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/74c1057f7991b4edb2bc7bdaa94de933/e/t/ethiopia-sidama-guji-daye-bensa-6.jpg","https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/74c1057f7991b4edb2bc7bdaa94de933/e/t/ethiopia-sidama-guji-daye-bensa-7_1.jpg","https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/74c1057f7991b4edb2bc7bdaa94de933/e/t/ethiopia-coffee-sidama-5.jpg"],"AdditionalAttributes":{"Appearance":".2 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen - mostly 15+, but we do see some smaller beans that are likely 14 screen","Arrival date":"September 2019 Arrival","Bag size":"60 KG","Certifications":"","Cultivar Detail":"Heirloom Cultivars","Drying Method":"Raised Bed Sun-Dried","Farm Gate":"Yes","Grade":"Grade 1","Lot size":"79","Packaging":"GrainPro Liner","Processing":"Wet Process (Washed)","Recommended for Espresso":"Yes","Region":"Shantawene Village, Sidama","Roast Recommendations":"City to City+ for brewed coffee, Full City for espresso","Type":"Organic/Fair Trade"}}

Thuti is part of the Othaya Farmer's Cooperative Society (FCS), who currently have 18 wet mills under their umbrella, some dating back to the late 1950s. \"Factories\" are essentially small washing stations aligned with a particular \"society\" in Kenya, what we would call a \"cooperative\". We return to the societies who seem to regularly produce some of the best Kenya coffees, and each year we come across societies that are new to us as well. The coffees from Othaya Factories have been on our radar for a long time and we've had the good fortune to buy a few stellar lots the past few years. The coffee from Thuti is grown between 1800 and 1900 meters above sea level, and the station serves hundreds of farmer members in the area. This is the peaberry outturn, when only one of the two seeds inhabiting the coffee cherry is fertilized. In this case (about 5% of coffee), the seed that is malnourished dies early on, leaving the lone fertilized seed to form into a rounded, circle-shaped bean. Because there's inherently such a small amount, the lot sizes tend to be small, this one coming in at only 5 bags. ","CuppingNotes":"Thuti Peaberry is a quintessential Kenya coffee in a lot of ways, and being our final Kenya coffee from the previous harvest, ends us on a proverbial 'high note'. Aromatically, this Peaberry offers a caramel sweetness in light roasts, smells of lemon cookie and dried fruit, with Full City roasts producing roast tones accented by a grape note in the fragrance. The wet aroma is a bit more muted in terms of fruit, but has a sweet smell of raw sugars that is nicely developed and a more subtle hint of fruit taffy. Brewing a City roast, the hot coffee shows a citric side that has a lemonade-like mouthfeel, with compact caramel sweetness underneath. Fruited notes  peak through the dense sweetness after the cup cools down a bit, with  flavor notes of red punch, raspberry, some citrus elements too like orange and a pith-like note of citrus rind. Full City roasts tone down the citric highs, which are traded in for flavor aspects of bittering dark cocoa. Thick, bittersweet chocolate syrup quickly shifts to plump fruited notes like blueberry and grape in the middle and finish.  ","Images":["https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/74c1057f7991b4edb2bc7bdaa94de933/k/e/kenya-nyeri-othaya-fcs-drymill-3_1.jpg","https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/74c1057f7991b4edb2bc7bdaa94de933/k/e/kenya-nyeri-othaya-factory-kiruga-2.jpg","https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/74c1057f7991b4edb2bc7bdaa94de933/k/e/kenya-othaya-fcs-nyeri-coffee-4_1_3.jpg"],"AdditionalAttributes":{"Appearance":".5 d/300gr, 15 Peaberry Screen","Arrival date":"September 2019 Arrival","Bag size":"60 KG","Cultivar Detail":"SL-28, SL-34","Drying Method":"Raised Bed Sun-Dried","Grade":"Peaberry","Lot size":"5","Packaging":"GrainPro Liner","Processing":"Wet Process Kenya Type","Region":"Thuti, Nyeri County","Roast Recommendations":"City to Full City","Type":"Farm Gate"}}

Typically, the coffee has already been processed down to the wet parchment and dried to roughly 50% moisture before being sold to the collector, who will then take the coffee back to their own facility where they will peel the parchment layer and dry the coffee the rest of the way (down to 10-12% moisture more or less). We call this method wet hulled, or \"Giling Basah\". \"Honey Labu\", on the other hand, is quite differently. \"Labu\" is the Bahasa word used for the wet-hulled, fresh green coffee. But in honey labu, the coffee is first processed like any honey, by removing the cherry and only some of the sticky mucilage/fruit which tends to impart fruited notes as well as bolster body. The coffee is then dried to approximately 30% moisture content at which time it is wet hulled (giling basah), peeling both the remaining mucilage and parchment from the seed while the coffee is still wet, and then dried the rest of the way. This step of the process is what constructs the earth-toned flavors we tend to associate with Sumatra, and certainly what popularized the coffees from this region.  But here we have a unique hybrid process that brings out the best of both worlds. A cup that is fruit-forward and sweet, big bodied and low toned, and complex through and through.","CuppingNotes":"From the outset, this \"Honey Labu\" Aceh lot shows fruited and rustic sweet aromatics. Smells of berry and mirky dried fruits are overlaid by rustic sweetness and complex herbal fragrance. The cup has a lot of the wet-hulled flavors we're accustomed to tasting from Aceh, date and palm sugar, herbal flavors, and tobacco. But along with that comes fruit and even mild acidic character. The fruited flavors that came to mind when cupping light and middle roasts alluded to raspberry, banana, lemon rind and a funky, tropical note. The cooled coffee presents intense sweetness and complexity unlike most other Aceh coffees we've carried. Full City roasts have a bittering layer similar to baking cacao with a dark fruited hint that adds a juicy quality to the brewed coffee. This mix makes sense when you see how the coffee was processed, a mixture of honey process, where the fruit is left intact for the first half of the drying phase, and Giling Basah, where the bean is stripped of the protective parchment layer (and fruit in this case) for the 2nd half of the drying phase.

I wanted it also to be complex and hint at all of those tastes, and more. Here's the product of a lot of overly-caffeinated days of experimentation: the Liquid Amber Espresso Blend. It is named for the rich color and multitude of crema it produces. The blend was fairly complex to come up with ... after I found the general tastes I wanted, emerging from aroma and first sip through the very long aftertaste (if I don't cleanse my palate with water I will taste this coffee for 20+ minutes) I needed to play with the exact percentages. The specific blend, hey ... it is my secret! But I will tell you that the 5 coffees that really worked toward the flavor goal I imagined ended up surprising even me! I will say that there are wet-processed coffees, a monsooned coffee, and even a modicum of quality washed Robusta. And to keep this a mystery, the blend contains some coffees not on our list. I admit this is a pretty wacky blend by the current fashion in espresso toward lighter-roasted and acidic coffees; it's downright dated really. But it works in it's own way. Some emphasis here is on the physical character of the espresso, hence the use of the monsooned coffee, which has properties in terms of crema that no other coffee possesses. Even in cupping the dynamics of the foam/bubbles are clearly different from other coffees due to the changes in the bean from the monsoon processing technique.  * a note on visual grade - the defect count will vary, but our \"1 full defect per 300g\" is us being on the safe side since the Monsoon coffee can have bug holes. That said, we buy the best visual and cup grade available (and we'll let it run out of stock rather than buy sub par product!) and this should not have an affect on flavor.","CuppingNotes":"Extracted in a properly functioning, clean espresso machine the blend produces a lot of crema, making the mouthfeel very thick and creamy. The sharp pungent bite to the blend is not bitter, and fades into a rich tobaccoy-milk chocolate aftertaste. If properly roasted (not scorched) the blend will not be ashy, something I really don't like in espresso. (With any espresso, if the aftertaste turns acrid and bitter after 3 minutes or so, clean the heck out of your machine.) In the Liquid Amber Blend there are hints of fruit, mushrooms, sweet smoke, caramel, and cream in the extended aftertaste. This blend works extremely well in milk drinks, meaning by that a true cappuccino (6-9 oz.) or machiatto. I make no claims for Latte ... is there any coffee that tastes potent mixed down 8:1 in a Slurpee-sized cup of milk? Please note: a long while back, I changed the type of Monsooned coffee. It is paler, sweeter, and is not a coffee we offer on our list at all times. It's a special purchase for the blend to increase sweetness and reduce mustiness. -Tom Liquid Amber Note:If the coffee arrives and doesn't appear evenly blended, this is because of the vibration during loading and shipment. I can positively guarantee you that the blend was packed in the exact, correct proportion (we are extremely careful about this), but the difference in size/density of the Monsooned/non-Monsooned can make them separate a bit with vibration. Just give it a stir....","Images":["https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/74c1057f7991b4edb2bc7bdaa94de933/l/i/liquid-amber-espresso-blend_2.jpg"],"AdditionalAttributes":{"Appearance":"1 d/300gr, 17-19 Screen - defect count will vary, but we're being on the safe side since the Monsoon coffee can have bug holes.

Either way, get this into 2nd crack and allow proper resting that espresso demands: 48+ hours is best.
