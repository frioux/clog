  "CuppingNotes": "The dry fragrance has smells of cocoa powder and cinnamon, along with light brown sugar and hazelnut. The wet aroma is has dense sweetness and pushes a smell of Mexican cocoa in the steam, with a sweet nutty side that's like almond paste. Drinking my lightest City roast, there's a toffee/caramel underlying sweetness with a flavor green tea that also defines the acidity. This H1 separation is fairly brilliant for El Salvador coffee and adds a mouth refreshing quality to a candied nut flavored finish (especially in lighter roasts). Full City roasts have roasted cacao nibs, chocolate syrup and more in the real of bitter-to-sweet roast tone. Fruited flavors also appear in these darker roasts like raisin and Mission figs. I pick up on some of that dried fruit character in espresso shots too, which brought to mind dark chocolate covered raisins.",
  "FarmNotes": "No, \"H1\" is not a Formula 1 car. It's a hybrid cultivar, also commonly referred to as \"Centroamericano\". It's also what's called an F1 hybrid, which are first generation offspring from two very different parent plants; in this case a Sarchimor (Timor hybrid and Villa Sarchi) and an African heirloom cultivar Rume Sudan. An important aspect of F1 hybrids is that you have to buy the 1st generation seeds in order to produce. Essentially, you can't re-plant seed from an F1 and expect to get the same \"Centroamericano\" characteristics like you would with other commercial varieties. The upside is that being 1st generation, they have what's called \"hybrid vigor\", which in this case is expressed as resistance to leaf rust (\"la roya\") and the ability to outproduce many of the older Bourbon and Caturra types. We've also noticed a somewhat delicate flavor profile with H1 cultivar that I can best describe as having citrus-like brightness and sometimes floral cup character; I think it comes through in this lot as vibrant acidity. Finca Miravalle is perched on the verdant slopes of the Apaneca-Ilamatepec mountain region. It's about 1500 meters above sea level, and is planted in Pacamara, Bourbon, H1 and Sanpacho, which owner Luis Duarte processes separately. This is an all H1 separation and tastes quite different from the Bourbon lot we're also selling. It's a great opportunity to taste two different cultivars from the same farm side by side!",

  "CuppingNotes": "\"Bombe\" is our final dry process lot from the Bensa group and offers just as complex of a cup as the other two from Shantawene and Keramo. In fact, as far as naturals go, this probably has the most \"dry process\" flavors of the three. That is to say, the fruit flavors come on incredibly strong. And while we scored it a whopping 93 points, our praise comes with a caveat: it's for those who truly enjoy big fruited flavors. Seriously. It will taste like flavored coffee to some, but I love it! Light roasts have notes of apple cider and mulling spice, some tea-like flavors too, and natural dried fruits are heavy handed as the coffee cools off. City+ roasts are very sweet and spiced as well. Dried fruit flavors are pervasive - stone fruit and berry - along with dark, pungent spice notes like cinnamon stick, clove and traces of nutmeg highlighting the aftertaste. The cup is so intense hot or cooled, and acidity level is moderate for Ethiopia, which helps to structure the flavor chaos (a slight exaggeration)! In our City+ roast we got a sense of the chocolate roast tones that can be achieved with roast development and the cocoa nib bittering qualities were reinforced by a waxy, think body. I'm sure these aspects would intensify further by roasting to Full City. Like Shantawene and Keramo, Bombe also has quite a few small beans in the mix and should be handled with some care when roasting, especially if you're shooting for Full City. The smaller beans are susceptible to charring if roasted too fast and hot. Pull back on the heat before 1st crack if you can, enough that it slows the roast down without stalling. If you're roasting in a popcorn popper, it might be best to stick to City - City+ roast levels.",
  "FarmNotes": "This coffee is one of two lots being sold under the \"Bombe\" name, the other being a fantastic wet process coffee yet to be listed. Both coffees come from a privately owned farm and processing site near Shantawene Village, tucked away in the Bombe mountains of Ethiopia's Sidama growing region. Along with coffee from their own farm called \"Daye Bensa\", they are buying and processing coffee from local farmers from three different growing areas nearby - Shantawene, Bombe and Keramo villages. The samples we tasted from all three sites scored very high and we wound up buying wet and dry process lots from all of them. This lot is a mix of coffees harvested from their own farm and outgrowers around Bombe village. It's certified organic too, which means that they register every farmer who they buy from and certify that organic agricultural practices are being employed at the farm level (they're also Rain Forest Alliance and UTZ certified, but we only brought in with the organic certificate). Ethiopian heirloom types are the main seeds cultivated and altitude ranges from just under 2000 meters to 2100 meters above sea level. It's worth noting that the screen size is on the small side too. The majority of the coffee is 15+, but we are spotting quite a few 14 screen beans in there too. The biggest concern here is that these smaller, lower density beans will roast faster than the largest coffee. While that can be true, we found that either sticking to City to City+ roast range or slowing down the last leg of the roast helps keep the small beans from charring and darker 'roast' flavors at bay.",

  "CuppingNotes": "I roasted Keramo to three different levels, City, City+ and Full City. I started with the darkest roast actually, but not on purpose. Part of the reason is that the 'crack' is very subtle at first in comparison to most other coffees and I just didn't hear it. Once I figured that out, I paid closer attention to both sight and sound and had no further issues. The coffee smells particularly sweet in lighter roasts. Both City and City+ have a raw sugar scent beneath bold berry and fruit smells that are much more than mere accents. They are what defines Keramo's cup too. It's a fruit bomb exploding with a multitude of fresh and dried fruited flavor notes and with impressive sweetness and clarity. Light roasts promise big fruit flavors of strawberry, rhubarb pie, dried banana and green melon. There's a bright aspect in the complex array of fruits that comes through like tart berry, and casts an acidic impression on the cup. More delicate spiced and floral accent notes highlight as the coffee cools, like jasmine, all spice and rue. Keramo is very juicy, quite clean for dry process coffee and has body like coconut water. It excels as a light roasted coffee and any darker than City+ risks compromising this flavorful brew by introducing smokey roast tones. ",

  "CuppingNotes": "Dark berry and citrus highlights are some of what makes this AA selection from Fram Farm so special. The aroma smells of dark brown sugar with hints of fruit jams. Blackberry, stone fruit and tangy lemon rind are a few of the top notes I picked out when cupping, along with subtle dry spice notes marking the aroma. As the coffee comes down in temperature, a tart citrus flavor helps shape Fram Farm's flavor profile, adding a sharpness to the cup. City roasts are going to be the brightest and Full City will round off the edges a bit, and bring out more of Fram Farm's berry and burned sugar characteristics. This medium-bodied coffee has a raw sugar sweetness underneath it all, and although I didn't roast beyond Full City, the mild cocoa roast tones that shadowed the cup are an indicator of what an even deeper roast might bring to the flavor matrix. City to City+ roast range will insure that you keep things light and bright, capturing so much of what makes Kenyan coffee so unique. Try as a pour over brew and you won't be disappointed.",
  "FarmNotes": "Kiambu lies near the foothills of Gatamaiyo Forest Reserve, and at the border of neighboring Muranga County. Fram Farm is owned and managed by the Kariruki family, James getting his start in coffee through a small plot he inherited from his grandfather. Now at 40, James has expanded their farm to nearly 30 hectares, the entirety planted in SL-28, and sitting at roughly 1850 meters above sea level. This is one of a few small estate coffees we were lucky enough to buy this year, coffees we had no direct connection with in the past. We tend to buy from the Farmers Cooperative Societies (\"FCS\"), and still do. But buying from a single estate affords us a different and unique opportunity to select coffee that we can trace back to its exact provenance, whereas with the FCS's, you're buying a blend of hundreds and sometimes thousands of small holders. This is certainly not a bad thing as some of our finest Kenyas are through FCS's, just different. We still turn to the coops for the majority of our coffee, but are hoping to continue to cultivate buying relationships with a small number of Kenyan small estates as well.",
