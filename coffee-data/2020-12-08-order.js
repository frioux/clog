The fragrance has caramelized sweetness, like a pungent toasted sugar smell, as well as intimations of dried fruit. Brewing a City or City+ roast promises tannic mouthfeel, the acidic impression somewhat subtle but structuring, and tea-like. As the cup cools off, accents of dried raisin and prune come through, along with an herbaceous accent note in aroma. Darker, Full City roasts are a home run as well, where you're left with a delicious low-toned cup, with complex chocolate roast and softer dark berry fruit hints.",
  "FarmNotes": "The coffees we've bought from the Caicedo region in the past all shared fruited cup characteristics. Like neighboring coffee region to the west, Urrao, Caicedo has very high altitude, good shade from the shadow of the mountain slopes, and plenty of fresh water from healthy rainy seasons. Fermentation times tend to be longer in this area due to the cold weather, and is part of the reason for the uniquely fruited cups. This coffee was purchased through a local association in Caicedo of which the three producers whose coffees make up this lot are members. Their coffee is grown near 2000 meters above sea level, and the cultivars grown are Caturra, and Variedad Colombia. \"Corredor de Las Alegrias\" is the name of a natural park that connects the high páramo alpine forest with the inhabited areas on the outskirts of Caicedo town. You pass through Corredor de Las Alegrias on one of the roads that connects Caicedo to Urrao (aptly named the \"Urrao-Caicedo\" road), and which follows the Urrao-Caicedo river.",

  "CuppingNotes": "Our second Pacamara lot from Santa Ana shares a lot in common with the last AA lot, but is perhaps a bit sweeter in the light roasts. Not that the last coffee wasn't sweet, but it seemed to take some roast development to unlock this trait to its full potential. Not the case with this AAA. The flavors in the cup with a light, City roast have brown sugar and citrus notes, sweet up front and impressions of tart orange in the back end. I don't think Full City roasts will disappoint folks looking for a clean, bittersweet cup. But the light to middle roasts are where tannic black tea and rindy citrus notes are focused, complex flavor accents that are mostly lost at a darker roast shade. There are tart and tannic notes in the hot brewed coffee that remind me of fine black tea with lemon, and the aftertaste has a sweet-to-bittering note. The different types of sweetness are more identifiable as the coffee cools off some, with notes of simple brown sugar, nougat and caramel topping my list. A lemon note is more muted but leaves its mark on the cup profile, and fades to a candied lemon peel flavor. This Pacamara has a complex flavor compound, somewhat atypical for the origin, though not unexpected from the Pacamara cultivar. ",
  "FarmNotes": "These 15 bags of Pacamara come from a group of 25 producers between Santa Ana and Chalatenango. This comes to us by way of a small export operation in Metepán, a project spearheaded by Alejandro Valiente who works with a handful of small producers in these regions. A lot of labor goes into processing small batches from each contributing farmer separately in order to build lot separations according to different quality tiers. This lot is a traditional wet process, undergoing 28-36 hours fermentation time before being laid to dry on shade-covered, raised beds for another 2-3 weeks. Farms are 2-4 hectares on average and span a moderate altitude range of 1250 to 1400 meters above sea level. Pacamara is a cross between two natural mutations of Typica and Bourbon lineage, Pacas and Maragoype. It's easily recognized by its large bean size as well as complex cup profile. Often yielding tea-like flavors and fruited sweetness, Pacamara cultivars often rank high in the cup of excellence competitions. This is one of two Pacamara lots we will have available this year from Alejandro, along with a Pacas separation from this same project.",

I've been enjoying the rounded mouthfeel that comes with full immersion brewing (I'm using the Rattleware Brewer, but French Press should be similar too). The flavor notes are in the realm of cooked sugars - caramel, toffee, and the like - and accented by honey graham and clean nut tones.

Dried berry - blueberry and blackberry to be specific - are most evident in the wet aromatics, and pretty intense overall. The cup has a complex interplay of chocolate bittering elements and fruit sweetness. Dried pineapple slices emerge in the mix of berry and tropical fruits - a cornucopia overall. There's a hint of dark malt and molasses as well. The coffee has fruited brightness but isn't tart: ripe pineapple communicates the type of acidity in the cup.

  "FarmNotes": "Dambi Uddo is the name of the town where this coffee processing site is located. It's one of a few wet mills that are operated by Guji Highland Farm, a group who manage their own large semi-forest coffee farms around the Guji area, as well as processing sites where they process their farm coffee as well as coffee from outgrowers in the area. This particular site in Dambi Uddo holds the name \"Wodessa\", which is also the name of the man who started this whole operation. Last year when we bought this coffee, they were only producing naturals at Wodessa. But this year they've installed a new Penagos mill so they can produce washed coffees as well (they're expecting around 8 full containers split between natural and washed). The station itself sits at 2000 meters above sea level and coffee is pulled from areas as high as 2200 meter. They buy coffee from a few different Kebeles nearby including Dambi Uddo, Hangadhi, Welena, Chaqta, Sewana, Banti Korbo and some from their own farms as well. Wodessa cooked us an incredible goat dinner when we visited last December and he insisted on putting us up for the night as well.

The dry fragrance has a scent of berry fruit leather (like \"Fruit Roll Ups) , a hint of brown Ale, and some sugar browning sweetness. Somehow, the wet aroma filters out a lot of the fruit, but it does not hinder sweetness, nor indicate what's to come in the cup. Without overpromising, berry/blueberry notes seem strongest at City/City+ roast levels, though still more of an accent flavor, and are identified by the confluence of actual berry flavor and brightness that comes with a ripe blueberry - almost tart. The fruit flavors are not wild or rustic, but fairly refined. After cooling down a bit, flavor notes of pancake syrup, fig jam, and a note of palm sugar come up in the flavor profile. This coffee is best suited for a \"light and bright\" roast approach, where a shimmering fruited acidity is found, and fruited hints when kept to the lighter end of the roast spectrum.",
  "FarmNotes": "Last year's export rule changes in Ethiopia gave farmers like Mansur Aba Hikam the opportunity to export their own coffee. In previous years, all private operations big and small had to sell their coffee through the government run Ethiopia Commodity Exchange and only cooperatives and unions were exempt. That probably sounds worse than it really was in terms of payments. But an issue presented to the buyer is that ECX coffee was stripped of provenance, save origin, so we never knew where it came from. Farmer Mansur Aba Hikam's coffee, for example, would've just been blended off with other coffees of a similar grade and sold as \"Limu Grade 1\". All that has changed and he is one of many farmers who have successfully applied for export licenses and are able to sell directly. His 18 hectare farm and wet mill are located near Kebele Kota, not far from Agaro town, and his coffee planted between altitudes of 1950 and 2000 meters above sea level. His coffee was delivered under his name, and is likely mostly the coffee from his farm. However, it is quite common for larger estate growers to incorporate coffee from family members and/or neighbors as well. Mansur Aba Hikam is one of a few single-farmer lots we were lucky enough to export directly this year.",

Light roasts are the most fruit-focused, while hitting the City+ threshold delights in a cup laced with cocoa and caramelized sugar sweetness, along with some of the more typical dry process-type fruited notes. I found Bobea to be a much more resinous smelling coffee than how it tastes, the more rustic undertones take a back seat in the brewed coffee, which is more fruit focused in the light roasts. 'Strawberry' was the first flavor to come to mind in my City roast level brew. The cup cools to an aromatic strawberry flavor, leaning toward an artificial flavoring type in intensity, and moves into some caramelizing sweetness that plays off the fruited tones like caramelized pineapple. Acidity level is moderate considering that dry process coffees are often on the flat side, and comes across like fruit juice. City+ sees cocoa roast flavors well integrated into the fruited profile, with a chocolate-covered strawberry flavor. The fruited flavor notes are somewhat obfuscated at Full City, though not gone altogether.",
  "FarmNotes": "Bobea Uke processing site serves roughly 1200 small holder coffee farmers in Woreda Odo Shakiso, Western Guji. Elevation at the site is roughly 2000 meters above sea level, and the farms they buy cherry from range from 1850 to 2250 meters above sea level. Each lot they produce is made up of coffee from hundreds of different farmers in the region, most with only a few hundred coffee trees or less. You tend to see coffee intercropped with other fruits and vegetables, \"false banana\" being one the more common food staples to see planted in the region. The false banana plant has many uses, and is widely utilized for it's starchy inners that are often fermented with yeast to make a bread (\"kocho\"), and the leaves can be transformed into roofs for houses, baskets, and more. Bobea coffee station is a privately run operation and they only produce dry process coffees at this time. Dry processing is the oldest processing method and involves drying the coffee bean and cherry whole. From pictures you see, you might think you can just dump the cherries to the beds and wait. This is not the case! The coffee has to be spread out to a layer depth of only a few centimeters, no more, in order to allow air flow. The coffee is turned hourly, or even more frequently, in order to facilitate even drying and keep the coffee from molding. It's not difficult, but requires constant attention. During this time of physical attention, workers continually pull out lower quality coffee in the form of physical defects and coffee that was not harvested at peak ripeness. This lot underwent several layers of hand picking from the whole coffee cherry to the final milled green coffee in order to achieve \"Grade 1\" status. ",

The dry fragrance is honey sweet and with mild floral hints, along with dried stone fruit, citrus peel and baking spice accent notes. The wet aromatics have a saturated honey smell, and breaking through the crust releases a pectin sweetness that brings to mind orange marmalade or peach preserves. The underlying sweetness in the brewed cup has flavor aspects of clover honey, which leads into layered fruit characteristics that go from the juiciness of stone fruit flesh on out to the bittering fruit skins. Lighter roasts are accented by orange peel and a complex herbal/rue aroma. Full City roast cast a bittersweet shadow onto dried stone fruited flavors and accented by kaffir lime, and tangy citrus-like acidity. Talk about a versatile Ethiopia. Dark roasting cannot hold back the complex fruit in Genji Challa's cup profile.",
  "FarmNotes": "Genji Challa is a wet milling site that is part of the Nano Challa Cooperative in Gera town, Agaro. It's only 3km from the Nano Challa site, and between them, their membership has grown. Doubling up wet mills allows the coop better serve members by growing their capacity as well as reach. Genji is outfitted with a Penagos 5000 ecopulper, and after the coffee is washed, it is moved to a skin drying table where it drip dries for a single day before being moved to raised beds to finish drying over the course of 10 days on average. The typical black netting you see wrapped around the tops of the drying tables are covered with jute bags in order to help keep the surface from absorbing heat while the coffee is drying. Both stations sit at just under 1900 meters, and the farm members have coffee as high as 2000 meters above sea level. The coop was formed as part of an initiative to aid farmers in a more comprehensive way. The program was administered by a non-government organization that not only coordinates agronomists and managers for each of the coops they work with, but also has a business adviser assigned that helps the cooperative manage their debt, re-invest in quality improvements at the mill, and verifies distribution of income to all members. They've since \"graduated\" from this program and are now part of an independent, local Union who assist the cooperatives with functions like marketing, exporting, and general representation on an international scale.",

The smell is really difficult to understand without firsthand experience (though I think the definition is synonymous to \"fresh\" in the dictionary). But thankfully, you don't need to smell the freshly opened bags to get a sense of how fresh these vacuum stored coffees taste. It costs a bit more to prepare this way, but in the end, this AB lot from Gachatha is worth the extra cost. Gachatha is the name of the factory, or wet mill, where members deliver coffee cherry for processing, and sorting before being delivered to the dry-mill where it is finally prepared for export. Gachatha used to be part of the much larger Tetu Farmers Cooperative Society (\"FCS\"), but broke away on its own almost 10 years ago. There are over 1000 small-holder farmer members, most with less than 200 trees - SL-28 and SL-34, French Mission hybrids produced by Scott Laboratories in the 1930s. The wet mill is located in the lower elevation area at 1300 meters, but coffee is grown up to 1800 meters in this region. This is an AB separation, the 15-17 screen bean size range (measured in 1/64ths of an inch). *please note, the vacuum seal may puncture in transit but the coffee is still protected and was vacuum sealed at origin",

  "CuppingNotes": "We found Kiruga AB to be intensely sweet at a wide range of roasts, ultimately scoring the 'sweetness' flavor category a whopping 9.5! The smells are sweet too, aspects of brown, unrefined sugars are fragrant and intense, with simple baking spice notes accenting this sweetness. Glimpses of dried fruits crop up in the steam after pouring the hot water on the ground coffee, and the rest filled out by floral brown sugar and cinnamon. The cup flavors at City roast level are lightly fruited, grape juice with mulling spice, fig butter and dried date, and a luscious sugar cane juice flavor is present from beginning on through to the finish. Full City roasts produce bittersweet roast flavors that come off like dark chocolate, highlighted by dark fruit accent notes. Both my City and Full City roast showed moderate acidic impressions, even mild for Kenya, but still quite vibrant compared to your average Latin American coffee.",
  "FarmNotes": "Kiruga is another wet mill under the Othaya Farmer's Cooperative Society (FCS) umbrella. Othaya has 18 wet mills, or what they call \"Factories\" in Kenya, and this particular cooperative society dates back to the late 1950s. \"Factories\" are essentially small washing stations aligned with a cooperative society in Kenya. We return to the societies who seem to regularly produce some of the best Kenya coffees, and each year we come across societies that are new to us as well. Being one of the older Kenya FCS, we are well aware of the quality coming out of Othaya, and have had the good fortune to buy a few stellar lots the past few years now. The processing site sits just above 1800 meters above sea level, and the farmer members are growing SL-28, SL-34 and Ruiru-11 cultivars at nearby farms between 1800 and 2000 meters. This is the AB out turn from a single harvest batch of coffee. Every process batch is made up of a wide range of different sized beans, and in Kenya, these sizes are grouped together by range measured in 1/16ths of an inch. These different classifications are referred to as \"out turns\", the most common being \"AA\" = 17-19 1/64\", \"AB\" = 15-17 1/64\", and peaberry.",

  "CuppingNotes": "This honey process lot impresses flavors of fruit and syrupy sweetness in the cup with subtle earth tones more of a hint than your typical wet-hulled coffee. That's because this isn't a typical wet-hulled Sumatra, but rather a process-hybrid of honey depulping with a lot of the fruit left intact, and then wet-hulling the seeds before they are completely dried. The result is so unique for Sumatran coffees, which are generally knows for being earthy, herbal, big bodied brews. The aroma has a fruited smell that reminds me of orange sour candies with a thin layer of toasted caramel sweetness. The wet aroma is a bit more herbaceous and has subtle earth tones like wetted green tea leaves, but also pungent fruit. The cup flavors at City and City+ allude to dried fruit and fruit pulp like that of raisin and stewed plum, along with some pipe tobacco in the finish. At Full City, the fruited profile is a bit more mirky but still present and the coffee finishes with a bittersweet note of roasted cacao nib. There's a lot going on here, and sticking to the lighter side of the roast spectrum will shine a light on this coffee's fruited and herbal side. Full City+ roasts boost the bittersweet undertone quite a bit, and retains a juiciness too, and I'm really taken a back by the impressive level of sweetness there is in such a dark roasted coffee. ",
  "FarmNotes": "This is a hybrid process of honey process and the wet-hull process that is traditional in Sumatra. \"Labu\" is the Bahasa word used for the wet-hulled, fresh green coffee. With \"honey labu\", the coffee is first processed like any honey, by removing the cherry and only some of the sticky mucilage/fruit which tends to impart fruited notes as well as bolster body. The coffee is then dried to approximately 30% moisture content at which time it is wet hulled (giling basah), peeling both the remaining mucilage and parchment from the seed while the coffee is still wet, and then dried the rest of the way. This step of the process is what constructs the earth-toned flavors we tend to associate with Sumatra, and certainly what popularized the coffees from this region.  But here we have a unique hybrid process that brings out the best of both worlds. A cup that is fruited and sweet, big bodied and low toned, and complex through and through.This coffee comes from a cooperative of farmers in the Gunung Tujuh and Kayu Aro areas, two higher elevation areas around Mount Kerinci. This particular coop are producing wet hulled, honey/wet hulled like this one, full honey and fully washed coffees. The farms in this area are planted in older Typica types, and benefit from the high slopes, situated between 1400 - 1500 meters above sea level.",
