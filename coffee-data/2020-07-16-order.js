  "CuppingNotes": "What a lovely smelling coffee, Kazoza N'Ikawa is perfumed in City and City+ roasts, a sugar browning sweetness along with a mix of clove spice and orange accents. The wetted grounds are so caramely sweet, like caramel cookies with raisins, and topped with a hint of cinnamon tea. City roasts brew nicely, delicious spiced sweetness notes up front, a compound of raw sugar flavors and delicate baking spice accents. A compromise is often made when light roasting, trading out developed sweetness for acidity and complexity. But this isn't the case with Kazoza N'Ikawa, and the cooling cup has a sweetness like sugarcane juice, that along with raisin and dried apple notes, resonate in the aftertaste. Acidity really pops at this roast level too and has a tart-sweetness like Palestinian sweet limes (if you haven't had them, they produce all the lime flavor without a puckering level of tartness!). Brewing my Full City roast, I was surprised by a dark grape hint that crops up after the temperature cools down a bit. Heavy dark chocolate roast tones are dominant, and the two pair well together, leaving behind a smokey-roast finish. Kazoza N'Ikawa is so sweet and complex from as light as City and on up to Full City roast levels, and those patient enough to let cool will be duly rewarded. ",
  "FarmNotes": "This coffee comes from Kazoza N'Ikawa, roughly translating to \"the future is coffee\". The cooperative assists members with marketing their coffees, handling cash flow, agronomical support, general business organization, and record keeping. This association has 57 stations in total operating in the Kayanza district of Rwanda. Hand sorting is intensive, and farm workers start sifting out under and over ripe cherry on delivery. Sorting of the parchment coffee continues at the drying tables, and then the green coffee is sifted through once again after dry-milling. They produce both washed and naturally processed coffees, this being a wet-processed lot that we bulked together from several day lot selections cup tested both in Burundi and back at our lab in Oakland. Bourbon is the dominant cultivar in the region (as is the case in most of Burundi), a variety known for syrupy sweetness when grown in high altitudes. ",

  "CuppingNotes": "Matari has a rustic appeal with syrupy sweetness, freeze-dried fruit, earth and spice notes, and a lot more. We certainly give them a pass in cleanliness given the long road Yemeni coffee takes before final export, but it is not a stretch to say they are some of the most complex coffees out there. The dry fragrance has a mixture of murky fruit character, malted milk powder, sandalwood and leather. The wet aromatics go from wood-spice incense to brown bread, as well as a smell of cooked squash and rustic sweeteners. Matari shape-shifts across roast levels and as the coffee temperature comes down a bit. This coffee is rustic for sure all along the roast spectrum - leathery, tobacco, sandalwood oil, chicory root, and more - but it has fruited notes too. My lightest City+ roast showed glimpses of slab apricot, freeze-dried strawberry, as well as an interesting cooked rhubarb note (even a bit on the 'tart' side). Taking development to Full City, a dried fig hint quickly gives way to rustic cocoa powder bittering, and a pipe tobacco accent leaves a lasting impression in the finish. Yemeni coffees need rest after roasting. They have more aromatics at 12 hours or 24 hours, but really develop at 72+ hours of rest after roasting. This is especially true for espresso. ",
  "FarmNotes": "\"Matari\" is one of the few coffees from the growing regions surrounding the high-altitudes of Sana'a that was traditionally kept separate. All others were mixed to form \"Sana'ani coffee\" with decidedly mixed outcomes. But coffee in Matari is a bit different, tall old-growth trees that appear like a fruit orchard than a typical coffee farm (well, NO coffee production in Yemen looks like a coffee farm anywhere else!). This lot was secured through Fatoum Muslot, who took over the family coffee business started by her father back in the 1950s. They've long exported Yemeni coffee, and since Fatoum has started managing the group, she has worked to implement practices such as more stringent hand sorting and using ecotact storage bags in order to directly affect their coffee's overall quality. We're quite pleased with the physical condition of both coffees we bought from Fatoum this year, the lack of underripe coffee and shipping in Ecotact liners has really benefitted the resulting cup quality. Their history in the trade has afforded them longstanding connections with farming groups in several growing regions, and because of these connections, are able to buy coffee in a more direct way. It's been a few years now since we've picked up Yemeni coffee, not necessarily by choice, but mainly due to the difficulties exporting from a country at war. The situation there is still quite dire, and I'm amazed that anything is making it out of the country. ",

The fragrance has caramelized sweetness, like a pungent toasted sugar smell, as well as dried fruit intimations. Brewing a City or City+ roast promises tannic mouthfeel, the acidic impression somewhat subtle but structuring. As the cup cools off, an accent of canned plum comes through, along with a greenish/herbal basil hint. The cup shows a bit more fruit than the fragrance lets on and light roasts cool to a nice dark berry flavor with a wine-like tang. The finish has a slight mouth-tightening aspect that sort of accentuates the tannic side of the cup. I loved my Full City+ roast. Dryness all but disappears and you're left with a delicious low-toned cup, with complex chocolate roast flavors and dark berry fruits.",
  "FarmNotes": "The coffees we've bought from the Caicedo region in the past all shared fruited cup characteristics. Like neighboring coffee region to the west, Urrao, Caicedo has very high altitude, good shade from the shadow of the mountain slopes, and plenty of fresh water from healthy rainy seasons. Fermentation times tend to be longer in this area due to the cold weather, and is part of the reason for the uniquely fruited cups. This coffee was purchased through a local association in Caicedo of which the three producers whose coffees make up this lot are members. Their coffee is grown near 2000 meters above sea level, and the cultivars grown are Caturra, and Variedad Colombia. \"Corredor de Las Alegrias\" is the name of a natural park that connects the high páramo alpine forest with the inhabited areas on the outskirts of Caicedo town. You pass through Corredor de Las Alegrias on one of the roads that connects Caicedo to Urrao (aptly named the \"Urrao-Caicedo\" road), and which follows the Urrao-Caicedo river.",

Getting right into the cup, acidity has both tea-like and fruited characteristics that have a mouth cleansing affect on the palate. This coffee's base flavors are very sweet and touch on a range of floral honey to raw panela sugar, a layered complexity that builds as the cup cools. The profile top notes come into focus as you move through the cup, especially in the light to middle roasts (City/City+), hints of golden apple, plum, and a dried stone fruit accent in the aftertaste. At Full City, robust, dark chocolate roast flavors are pervasive in the cup, but Las Estrella's fruited characteristics and mouthfeel are still quite buoyant at this roast level too. Full City and FC+ roasts make a great SO espresso option showing equal levels of bittering cacao tones and baked sugar sweetness, with a dark fruited note accenting the finish.",
  "FarmNotes": "\"Las Estrellas\", is a name we use for a regional blend of high scoring coffees from Inzá, Cauca. This season's Las Estrellas is made up from 4 different coffee farms, 3 of which are from Vereda San Antonio. We see a similar trend of cultivar planting and processing techniques in this region. Most of the farms are less than 2 hectares in size, Caturra heavily represented, with Variedad Colombia and Typica mixed in. The majority of coffee production is performed using depulpers powered by small gas motors or by hand crank, then fermented overnight, and finally drying in covered drying rooms (\"parabolicos\"). The latter helps protect the unstable, wet parchment from the elements, and ventilation facilitates good airflow and even drying. Altitude on the low end is about 1500 meters and tops out closer to 2000. We used to purchase our coffee through a local cooperative in Inzá. Last year, we moved away from the cooperative after learning of coffee and finance mismanagement and lack of farmer outreach. One of the key players at the coop ventured out on their own and has built out a buying operation adjacent to his home in the village of San Antonio, Inzá. He and his family have invested their own money in erecting a warehouse where they can buy and store coffee and a state of the art coffee lab for processing farm samples, cupping, and training exercises for those interested. They are well connected within the community and volume/quality has not suffered one bit under their direction! You can read more about the operation in our blog post Colombia: New Projects, Familiar Faces.",

The perceived brightness is moderate in the light roasts with a twist of lemon and raspberry impressions on the cup and the aftertaste has a 'root' note that offers something like earthy sweet sarsaparilla. Full City roasts introduce layers of dark cacao/roast-bittering flavors that are interspersed with sweet dark fruited flavors, and body as big as the flavor profile.",
  "FarmNotes": "The Katana station is one of a handful of Congo coffee processing sites under a privately ran coffee project called Virunga Coffee. Their primary goals have been to help increase production and the overall quality of the coffee through investment in infrastructure like wet mills and raised drying beds, farmer outreach and access to the global market. The Katana site is located in South Kivu and serves several hundred farmers in the region. Katana sits at 1700 meters above sea level and the farmed area spans a range of 1450 to 1750 meters, benefiting from high altitude and nutrient rich, volcanic soil. Farmers are growing Blue Mountain, a mutation of Typica first discovered in the Jamaica's Blue Mountains. Katana are only producing natural and honey process coffees which have a much lower demand for water. The Virunga Coffee group have also assisted with certifications (UTZ and Organic) that not only lend to sustainable agricultural practice, but also ensure an added price premium for the coffee.",

Body is moderate at this level, and at Full City seems much more dense and opaque, as do the accompanying bittersweet cocoa roast tones. It has moderate tea-like acidity and at City+ finds balance between brightness, flavor and body (that's a good starting place for roast level in my opinion). Finca Matalapa makes for a classic-toned SO espresso at Full City roast, heavy cocoa roast flavor is accented by an orange zest note and followed by creamy macadamia nut in the aftertaste.",
  "FarmNotes": "Finca Matalapa is a classic estate coffee, long before there were mini-mills and micro-lots. It has a complete independent mill to service the farm, from the tree through wet-processing, patio drying, hulling, preparation, to loading the coffee in jute bags and packing the shipping container. The mill is filled with fantastic, classic coffee equipment painted in bold colors. And it's the passion of the owner, Vickie Ann Dalton de Diaz, and the mechanical love of the archaic on the part of her Francisco Diaz that keeps the mill running and the coffee tasting so wonderful! Finca Matalapa is in the Libertad area, not far from the capital of San Salvador, on a west-facing slope ranging from 1200 meters up to the ridge top at 1350 meters. It's a 4th generation coffee estate totaling 120 hectares and was founded in the late 1800's by Fidelia Lima, great grandmother of the Vickie. She maintains 14 acres of virgin tropical forest and keeps her coffee plants shaded with over forty varieties of larger trees.",

Second time around, I pulled 1:20 after the first audible snaps and the roast was a perfect City roast level (for me, at least!). The fragrance and aroma at City and City+ have a subtle smell of dried peach, brown sugar and a light herbal note. The fruited flavors in the cup are more potent than the aromatic profile and are integrated into a compact, sweet brew. The cup fades to herbal rue and tropical fruit aromatics, mango and orange marmalade hints and a soft floral highlight. Light roasts are the brightest and also produce the delicate aromatics that are unique to Ethiopian coffees. But even at Full City, Kenisa manages to produce a fruited underlayer amidst the bittersweet roast tone, as well as syrupy texture and sweetness.",
  "FarmNotes": "Kenisa station is a newer coffee processing site run by the farmer's cooperative union we buy from in Agaro, who also manage Duromina, Nano Challa, Kedamai and others. \"Kenisa\" is the Oromifa word for \"bee\", and symbolizes the hard working people of the region. This region happens to produce some of the most incredible white honey we've tasted in Ethiopia, so the name is particularly fitting! The Kenisa station has registered 305 members since starting up 2 years ago. Initially, they set out on their own but lacked access to getting their coffee to the international market. The Agaro Union is well situated in this respect and is connecting them to a much wider network of buyers (lucky us!). We visited the site last January and the cleanliness and organization were impressive. They employ a water conserving Penagos 2500 to depulp the coffee and the machine looks brand new. We found the coffee from Kenisa to have a stone fruit flavor characteristic common to coffee from this region. Light roasts are delicious and the most vibrant cups. I noticed quite a few latent 'snaps' at the end of 1st crack making degree of roast a bit difficult to judge by sound alone. If you are shooting for a light roast, I would err on the side of caution and pull the roast 1:20 or so after 1st C begins and adjust from there.",

  "CuppingNotes": "Tuma Tesso has a sweetness that reminds me of graham cracker crust on a cheese cake, a mixture of honey graham crackers, brown sugar and butter caramelizing as it bakes. The wet aroma doesn't stray too far from this, though the level of intensity builds (as it does when adding hot water to the grinds) and a subtle stone fruit accent note escapes in the steam. The cup shows more stone fruit characteristics as it cools, flavors of ripe apricot and nectarine are folded into a baked brown sugar sweetness and lend to fruit-floral aromatic hints (like ripe peach for example). Acidity is quite nice at City roast level, lending to a fruited impression on the cup. The interplay of tangy and sweet leads to tart fruited accents, like a puckering yellow cherry. It's best to stick to light roasting with this coffee as Full City roasts flatten the cup, developing bittersweetness but also a coffee that is much more two-dimensional in character. City roasts are so delicious, and pour-over brewing teases out the vibrant, complex profile.",
  "FarmNotes": "The Tuma Tesso processing site is a newer washing station near Agaro town in Western Ethiopia. It is managed by a coffee farmer's union we buy from who are behind some of our oldest Ethiopia direct partnerships, like Duromina and Nano Challa. Initially, Tuma Tesso set out on their own but lacked access to get their coffee to the international market. The Agaro Union is well situated in this respect and is connecting them to a much wider network of buyers (lucky us!). We passed the site on a visit in January but just couldn't squeeze in the stop due to an already busy schedule of site visits that day. Hopefully we can visit on our next trip later this year. Tuma Tesso roasts easily in that the dense beans withstand high heat, leading into a gentle, rolling 1st Crack. I was impressed by my lightest, City roast and recommend keeping to that end of the roast spectrum.",

  "CuppingNotes": "You get a sense of Rosma's sweetness straight from the grinder. The dry fragrance has brown sugar sweet smells, along with dried fruited notes like raisin. The wet aroma melds a smell of cooked raisin with a well-developed, sugar-browning sweetness that comes off pretty intense. Rosma is a coffee that cups so well, but brews even better. It's one of those perfectly balanced Guatemalan coffees that may not have wild fruit-forward cup notes, but is showy in it's cleanliness and overall level of sweetness. City and City+ roasts offer the brightest cups, with fruited acidity that adds mouth-cleansing affect to the deep, raw sugary sweetness. The flavor compound culminates in allusions to oatmeal-raisin cookies made with brown sugar, cooling to an accent of black currant. Full City roasts produce layers of deep cacao bittersweetness, intermixed with mild, dark fruit accent notes and a hint of dried coconut. Beyond Full City brings out smokey roast flavors which I'm not as much of a fan of, but I can see hitting 2nd snaps if you're wanting a coffee that stands up to milk. We pulled a shot of espresso with our Full City roast, and it was so delicious - thick, rich chocolate flavors, deep bittersweetness with a surprising hint of dried plum.",
  "FarmNotes": "Finca Rosma is owned by the Morales family, managed by the son Fredy. The name is in honor of his grandmother, Rosemarie. It's located on a high ridge where you drive in to the farm at nearly 1900 meters, then descend down to the mill at around 1600 meters (just check out the dizzying slope on the other side of the cherry 'weighing' station in the 1st pic). When Alejandro Rosales bought the farm in 1963, the only way to get there was by foot, or horseback. It's not that easy of a trek by road, either. The farm is quite steep, typical for the high ridges of the Sierra Los Cuchumatanes mountains. I found the plantings to be quite a jumble of cultivars. There were certainly a lot of old Bourbon trees, but I saw many Typica (Arabigo), and some Caturra and Catuaí as well. There were red and yellow varietals too. Processing is mostly wet-process, traditional fermentation, but they are working with a very tight space; there is not a lot of flat areas in this topography. So they have to manage their batch sizes carefully or they will rapidly run out of patio space for sun-drying the coffee, though partially remedied with the addition of a large area of raised drying beds (a welcome addition!). Regardless of the details, they are producing an amazing coffee, and I wouldn't suggest that they change a thing!",
