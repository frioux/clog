City+ to Full City+. Good for espresso.","Score":86.1,"URL":"https://www.sweetmarias.com/brazil-dry-process-fazenda-campos-altos.html","FarmNotes":"Jose Maria de Oliveira. This particular farm tops out around 1200 meters above sea level, and is planted in several different varietals, this being a Topazio separation (a cross between Mundo Novo and Catuai, that is relatively short in stature, and high yield). This is dry processed lot, meaning the whole cherry is picked from the tree and then laid out to dry for roughly 30 days, after which the dried cherry and parchment layer are mechanically removed. This type of processing tends to impart some fruited flavor on the seed, as well as mute acidity, and produce big body. Roasting can be a little tricky, because there is usually much more chaff produced. Yes, chaff is messy, but more so, it is dark in color, and if still connected to the bean can give the impression that a coffee is darker than it actually is. The coffee benefits from a couple day's rest too, where the cup profile really seems to come together and find harmony.","CuppingNotes":"This lot from the Campos Altos farm \"Serrinha\" displays an edgy fruit quality that often comes with dry processing. For my personal taste I don't find it to be over the edge, but rather getting into the wine-like berry realm while still retaining convincing sweetness underneath. Don't expect the cup clarity of a Grade 1 Ethiopian dry process, the cooked and dried fruit flavors are more difficult to pinpoint, but show flavor elements of overripe berry, dried prune, and more. The cup has both sweet and nutty flavors at City+, and creamy body gives this somewhat rustic profile staying power. Full City roasts develop dark baking chocolate flavors too, and the prune/date dried fruit notes remain a big part of the cup. A worthy and somewhat wild espresso option on it's own, or tone it down by blending with a pulp natural Brazil, or perhaps a washed Central American coffee.","AdditionalAttributes":{"Appearance":".8 d/300gr, 15+ screen","Arrival date":"November 2018 Arrival","Bag size":"60 KG","Cultivar Detail":"Topazio","Drying Method":"Patio Sun-dried","Farm Gate":"Yes","Grade":"Estate","Lot size":"80","Packaging":"GrainPro Liner","Processing":"Dry Process (Natural)","Recommended for Espresso":"Yes","Region":"Campos Altos, Minas Gerais","Roast Recommendations":"City+ to Full City+","Type":"Farm Gate"}}
{"Title":"Sweet Maria's New Classic Espresso","Overview":"A classic, balanced espresso, but without the baggage of the old world espresso conventions ...and without robusta! The espresso has balanced bittersweet notes, thick and opaque body, almond and chocolate roast flavors, hints of peach tea, spice, jasmine.","Score":87,"URL":"https://www.sweetmarias.com/sweet-maria-s-new-classic-espresso.html","FarmNotes":"Once there was \"Classic Italian,\" our espresso blend to set the benchmark for traditional European-style espresso. It was a blend based on quality Brazil coffees, with a touch of aromatic Central American coffee to add a grace note to the cup, and it had a small percentage of premium robusta in it for crema, mouthfeel, and to add traditional flavors found on the continent. But times change and tastes change. Espresso culture is much less Euro-centric, and for good reason. While Italy gave us espresso, the general quality of street-level espresso there can be exceptionally poor. Don't even talk about coffee in France. The big brands in Europe are largely run by multi-nationals who keep a close watch on price, and gleefully buy lower quality green coffee if they can save .01 Euro. The privates follow suit, in order to compete. Of course, there are many exceptions, but the darker roast styles, well into 2nd crack, to cover up the use of low quality green coffee ... well, that is NOT something to emulate. For Sweet Maria's, espresso has never been our \"dumping ground\" for coffees we can't sell, old lots, or ones with mild defect. It's been a program where we have dedicated much time, focus in cupping, and roast testing. With this in mind, we want to start over again, and offer New Classic, a somewhat silly name, an oxymoron, and overused ... but it says what I want it to say: Here is the new benchmark espresso with sweet-bittersweet balance, body, crema, and finesse, the core definition of the espresso beverage, and defines it in the established West Coast espresso style (clean, bright notes) without the burden of European espresso conventions. In other words, no robusta! No obsessive interest in crema! (You can produce buckets of crema in espresso and still have a very mediocre-tasting cup. What ... do you make espresso just to look at the beautiful crema? No dummy, you make it to drink it!)","CuppingNotes":"While this blend is designed primarily for a lighter roast, stopping the roast before 2nd crack, it also works well with a darker roast treatment. It does not have the extreme brightness that have been the trademark of some of our Espresso Workshop blends; it is a bit more restrained in it's overall demeanor. The cup has a balance between sweet and bittersweet flavors, moderate bright accent, soft traces of fruit, body and depth. The lighter roasts have a very sweet aromatic, fruited with plum and a hint of spice (cinnamon stick, cardamom). Darker roasts tend toward chocolate laced with dark fruit tones, in both aroma and cup flavor. Both have a firm, opaque body, with toasted almond roast notes as the espresso cools. In the aftertaste, peach tea flavor (and it light roasts a bit of jasmine tea) are evident. Of course, results vary with how the espresso machine and grinder are set up. We use 8.5 bars of pressure at the head, with 202 degrees water temperature (measured at the head) to start, dropping to about 198. At higher temperatures, it's a more aggressive espresso with a bittersweet edge and well-suited to milk drinks.","AdditionalAttributes":{"Appearance":".6 d/300gr, 15-18 Screen","Cultivar Detail":"Varies","Grade":"Top Grade","Processing":"Varies","Roast Recommendations":"We recommend a range of roasts from FC, FC+ to light Vienna.

This is from the same station owner, Kedir Hassan, the older sibling to Esmael Hassan, who you may remember as the producer of another Guji coffee we've also carried, Kayon Mountain. \"Dabaye\" is the name of the kebele where this Hambela station is located (a town, more or less). We were lucky enough to sleep at this station on our December 2018 visit sleeping in a pair of military tents replete with cots, overlooking the couple hundred drying tables below us. Kedir is a proficient and capable engineer as well as coffee farmer, and built the entire Hambela station in one season. You wouldn't know this, as it's visually apparent everything was built with high processing standards, and efficiency in mind. Of course he did not complete Hambela on his own, and thanks to his long standing connection with the the people in this area, he had much needed community support. Hambela sits at 1816 meters above sea level, and coffee is grown as high as 2100 meters. They mostly buy coffee from farmers in the surrounding kebeles of Buliye, Wamana, Borticha, Dari Rogicha and Dabaye, of course.","CuppingNotes":"After last year's standout dry process \"Hambela Hassan\" coffee, we anticipated high quality from this year's lot. Hambela Dabaye certainly delivers. Light roasts have berry fruit and a baking spice laden fragrance, with creamy vanilla/caramel sweetness underneath. The aroma has a strawberry jam element, fruit/berry and caramelizing sugar sweet smells lace the aromatically potent steam. City and City+ roasts are pretty amazing when brewed as pour over. The cup is remarkably clean considering how this coffee is processed. Berry notes are evident right off the bat, strawberry jam and berry-like brightness illuminating the cup. Fruited notes hint at sweet citrus and peach puree, and the flavors are juicy and clean. I prefered my lightest roasts of Hambela, where fruit and even a tart acidic impression are present. It cups most like a washed coffee in this context, albeit a fruit forward washed coffee. Full City roasts are still delicious but trade vibrance and clear fruit flavors for pleasantly bittering roast tone more dried fruit characteristics. If you're looking for a dry process Ethiopia espresso, this is the one to pick up (of the two currently listed) as body is opaque and weighty. But because I think this is too wild for the average espresso drinker, I'm withholding the espresso recommendation from the coffee \"specs\" tab and short description.","AdditionalAttributes":{"Appearance":".7 d/300gr, 15+ Screen - some partial quakers in the roasted coffee","Arrival date":"June 2019 Arrival","Bag size":"60 KG","Cultivar Detail":"Heirloom Varietals","Drying Method":"Raised Bed Sun-Dried","Farm Gate":"Yes","Grade":"Grade 1","Lot size":"160","Packaging":"GrainPro Liner","Processing":"Dry Process (Natural)","Region":"Dabaye Kebele, Shakisso, Guji","Roast Recommendations":"City to Full City","Type":"Farm Gate"}}

Good for espresso.","Score":89.8,"URL":"https://www.sweetmarias.com/ethiopia-agaro-duromina-coop-lot-17-6118.html","FarmNotes":"This coffee from Duromina Cooperative is part of an initiative we have in Ethiopia to work direct at the coop level. We have been involved with Duromina for several years now, selecting our favorite lots from the separations they put together starting early in the season. Duromina was formed with the help of a non-government organization that not only coordinated agronomists and managers for each of the coops they work with, but also had a business adviser assigned that helped the cooperative manage their debt, re-invest in quality improvements at the mill, and verifies distribution of income to all members. This is a key position; I have never known a coop to get this kind of expert advice from outside ... not in Africa at least. A cooperative can make all kinds of quality improvements, turn out fantastic coffee, and sink deeper in debt all the while. Cooperatives often fail to return a fair and full amount of payment to their farmer-members. Often this is from poor management, and sometimes from graft as well. Duromina \"graduated\" from the NGO program a few years bvack and operates independently with the oversight of a farmer-member leadership group. Duromina is in the Goma region of Agaro Woreda, with farm altitudes between 1900 to 2100 meters. The name, chosen by the farmers, has quite a straight-forward meaning: it roughly translates as \"Make More Money!\" With the solid price Duromina receives for their coffee, and their success reinvesting in the Goma area, the name has proved quite appropriate. NPR did an interesting audio piece on this coop a few years back: Cinderella Story.","CuppingNotes":"Duromina's high level of sweetness and intense fruited notes are apparent right from the get go. The dry fragrance is front-loaded with stone fruit jam, a layer of honey sweetness, and mixed fruit and spice smells. Adding the hot water brings up a scent of dark honey, and the wetted crust seemingly saturated with stone fruit sweetness. The cup flavors echo the aromatics in multi-layered fruit tones, subtle floral hints, and unrefined sugar sweetness. City roasts make for the brightest cups, a subtle lemon tea high note backs syrupy flavors of nectarine, orange marmalade, and an herbal rue note. The sweetness is like burned caramel, intensity increasing with roast tone, and Assam tea accent comes through in the finish. City+ roasts are more bodied and flavor notes like apricot and peach skin coming to mind. Chocolate tones are the trade off with more roast development. Not a bad thing at all, especially if you prefer roast intensity, though fruited flavors are not compromised. Top notes of dark berry and a semi-rustic natural dried apricot note come up, fading to a cacao-laden finish. Acidity level is moderate in comparison to some of the Yirga Cheffe's we've carried, but structuring none the less. Duromina is wonderful as SO espresso too, creamy in mouthfeel, and flavors of dried stone fruit and dark chocolate sauce are attention grabbing.","AdditionalAttributes":{"Appearance":".6 d/300gr, 15-18 Screen - a few partial quakers, but overall quite clean","Arrival date":"June 2019 Arrival","Bag size":"60 KG","Cultivar Detail":"Heirloom Varietals","Drying Method":"Raised Bed Sun-Dried","Farm Gate":"Yes","Grade":"Grade 1","Lot size":"100","Packaging":"GrainPro Liner","Processing":"Wet Process (Washed)","Recommended for Espresso":"Yes","Region":"Goma, Agaro","Roast Recommendations":"City to Full City","Type":"Farm Gate"}}

The altitude at the farm ranges from 1200 to 1350 meters above sea level and this lot is a blend of the different cultivars they are growing which include, Bourbon, Caturra, Pacas, Sanpacho and Marsallesa. The latter two are Sarchimor hybrid types - a cross of Villa Sarchi and Timor hybrid - bred for disease resistance. The coffee is harvested and then transported to be milled nearby at Beneficio San Miguel, where the cherry is first graded by ripeness (the coffee has to be 95% ripe cherry before it is depulped - everything else is reserved for lower grades). Beneficio San Miguel's honey processing technics are a little more involved than what we typically see. After depulping the coffee, leaving some of the fruit intact, they bag up the wet, sticky parchment into jute and let it sit overnight in order to start a sort of dry fermentation. Then the coffee is laid out on raised African drying beds for about a week before being finished on patios. ","CuppingNotes":"The dry fragrance shows raw sugar sweetness, with raisin and fig smells, and a bit of a winey hint. The wet aroma is more straight-forward with prominent caramelizing sugar sweetness, fruits merely hinted at in the steam. The cup is sweet and finishes clean, and fruited character is a focal point in both light and more developed roasts.

The Kayon Mountain group both own a private farm and run a few coffee processing sites in Guji. \"Taaroo\" is one of these sites where they produce dry process and wet process coffees. Taaroo gets its name from the kebele in which it is located (the \"town\", more or less). The Taaroo site was erected 8 years ago and is outfitted with a 4-disc depulper, 14 fermentation tanks for the washed coffees, and over 200 drying tables. They buy coffee cherry from the farmers in the Taaroo area and process their coffee along with their own farm coffee, blending together by process day and grade. Altitude ranges from 1900 meters to above 2100.","CuppingNotes":"This lot from Taaroo is another of the \"cleaner\" representation of dry process coffee. Clearly still fruit forward from the get-to, flavors have refined definition and without the rustic haze of more typical DP examples. The dry fragrance and wet aroma have potent berry smells that are like fruit jam, raspberry, blueberry, ginger soda, and a lovely perfumed floral smell. The coffee is very clean for dry process, flavors of fresh and dried fruits, baking spice and stunning floral aroma become more and more vivid as the coffee cools. I pick up on a lot of berry characteristics in City and City+ roasts, blueberry hard candy, raspberry fruit roll up, mixed berry jam for example. These lighter roasts have the most floral character too, star jasmine and lilac, with finishing flavor hints of cherry and green grape. My Full City roast was underpinned by chocolate roast tone, but in my opinion, an unfair compromise of fruited and floral character that are muted with too much roast development. Save the dark roasting for a less complex Ethiopia.","AdditionalAttributes":{"Appearance":".7 d per 300 gr; 15+ screen - spotted a few partial quakers in the roasted coffee (the light tan color beans)","Arrival date":"June 2019 Arrival","Bag size":"60 KG","Cultivar Detail":"Heirloom Varietals","Drying Method":"Raised Bed Sun-Dried","Farm Gate":"Yes","Grade":"Grade 1","Lot size":"160","Packaging":"GrainPro Liner","Processing":"Dry Process (Natural)","Region":"Taaroo Kebele, Shakiso, Guji Zone","Roast Recommendations":"City to City+","Type":"Farm Gate"}}

It's a hybrid cultivar, also commonly referred to as \"Centroamericano\". It's also what's called an F1 hybrid, which are first generation offspring from two very different parent plants; in this case a Sarchimor (Timor hybrid and Villa Sarchi) and an African heirloom cultivar Rume Sudan. An important aspect of F1 hybrids is that you have to buy the 1st generation seeds in order to produce. Essentially, you can't re-plant seed from an F1 and expect to get the same \"Centroamericano\" characteristics like you would with other commercial varieties. The upside is that being 1st generation, they have what's called \"hybrid vigor\", which in this case is expressed as resistance to leaf rust (\"la roya\") and the ability to outproduce many of the older Bourbon and Caturra types. We've also noticed a somewhat delicate flavor profile with H1 cultivar that I can best describe as having lemon grass and even floral cup character. I don't know that they're all this way, but the El Salvador and Mexico coffees we picked up this season certainly have that in common. Finca La Esperanza borders El Boqueron National Park, a majestic natural forest that is home to a multitude of wildlife, and a main feature of San Salvador’s volcano crater. After the leaf rust crisis, most farmers in the region let the original Bourbon and Pacas cultivars die off, replanting with rust-resistant varieties that unfortunately also produce an inferior cup. However, La Esperanza has kept most of its original tree populations, which farm managers have kept productive and healthy by implementing integrated farming practices. The farm is broken into several plots, most with intermixing of Arabigo (Typica) and Bourbon. La Esperanza benefits from being able to hire the same group of pickers each harvest, who know the farm well, and know which cherries are ripe enough to pick. The coffee is transported to a mill in San Miguel where each batch is processed individually under strict processing protocols to ensure the quality of the beans are maintained. La Esperanza is a fairly large farm, and altitude ranges from 1000 to 1350 meters above sea level. ","CuppingNotes":"The dry fragrance has transparent sweet smells in light roasts with hints of nut and roasted barley. City+ and Full City show more developed sweetness, a scent of raw sugar mingling with a sweet hazelnut smell. The wet aromatics are more complex and you catch a glimpse of herbal tea amidst a cooked raw sugar smell that sends caramelized sweetness wafting in the steam. The cup is much more delicate than the fragrance might let on and this H1 separation from Finca La Esperanza is a fairly nuanced brew when roasted light. Drinking my City roast, there're toffee/caramel underlying flavors with top notes of lemon grass, roasted barley and green tea. The tea-like flavors have a mouth cleansing affect on the finish, as well as add a lemony acidic impression that lends a 'zippy' tart characteristic to the cup. Full City roasts are much more two dimensional, delivering a well-balanced cup with more substantial body, and flavor notes of roasted cacao nibs and caramel.","AdditionalAttributes":{"Appearance":".4 d/300gr, 16-18 Screen","Arrival date":"June 2019 Arrival","Bag size":"69 KG","Cultivar Detail":"H1 Centroamericano","Drying Method":"Patio Sun-Dried","Farm Gate":"Yes","Grade":"SHG","Lot size":"30","Packaging":"GrainPro Liner","Processing":"Wet Process (Washed)","Region":"Quetzaltepeque, La Libertad","Roast Recommendations":"City to Full City - I preferred the \"light and bright\" cups the most","Type":"Farm Gate"}}
