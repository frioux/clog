The Murathe's have roughly 40 hectares of coffee planted, mostly SL bourbon types. We had a chance to tour the farm and milling facility onsite a couple years ago and they run an impressive operation. Their washing station is in good order, tidy and organized, as is their farm. The trees are well spaced and pruned, and appeared to be out-producing others we visited in the area, no doubt as a result of agronomical care. This is the AA outturn, and we also picked up a peaberry selection too which sold out in about a day! Both show impressive fruit flavors, with enough acidity to structure cup complexity. The physical quality of the green measures out nicely too, and I did not see any full quaker beans in the few hundred grams I roasted, and only a few hollow beans (\"shells\") which don't have an affect on cup flavor in small number. I'm recommending to roast Ibutiti light in order to capture complexity at its apex.","CuppingNotes":"The complex cup characteristics of this AA lot are hard to miss and are incredibly enticing. The fragrance at City roast level is rife with refined sweetness, baking spices, and red fruits. The sweetness only intensifies in the wet aroma, releasing a smell of brown sugar and cinnamon crumble, along with dark currant jam, and a grape accent note in the steam. Roast tones are kept in check when sticking to the recommended roast range of City to City+, still managing to develop big sweetness, buoyant fruited flavors, and a complex spiced aroma in the brewed coffee. The cup flavors cover a lot of ground, going from raw sugars, to grape and orange notes, cardamom pod tea, accents of concord grape jelly, and a ripe dark berry. The backdrop is very tea-like, black tea to put a fine point on it, adding to the vibrant lemon-like acidic impression and mouthcleansing finish. I'm enjoying the cup clarity from my V60 brews of a City roast, where acidity takes center stage as it ought to in Kenyan coffee.","Images":["https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/d03ea31552bd1b5f4cc7e80acbe033cb/k/e/kenya-gatanga-nyeri-coffee-ibutiti-6_2.jpg","https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/d03ea31552bd1b5f4cc7e80acbe033cb/k/e/kenya-gatanga-nyeri-coffee-ibutiti-2_2.jpg","https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/d03ea31552bd1b5f4cc7e80acbe033cb/k/e/kenya-gatanga-nyeri-coffee-ibutiti-3_3.jpg"],"AdditionalAttributes":{"Appearance":".4 d/300gr, 17-19 Screen","Arrival date":"May 2021 Arrival","Bag size":"60 KG","Cultivar Detail":"SL-28, SL-34","Drying Method":"Raised Bed Sun-Dried","Farm Gate":"Yes","Grade":"AA","Lot size":"7","Packaging":"GrainPro Liner","Processing":"Wet Process (Washed)","Region":"Gatanga, Thika","Roast Recommendations":"City to City+","Type":"Farm Gate"}}

Fram Farm is owned and managed by the Kariruki family, James getting his start in coffee through a small plot he inherited from his grandfather. Now at 40, James has expanded their farm to nearly 30 hectares, the entirety planted in SL-28, and sitting at roughly 1850 meters above sea level. This is one of a few small estate coffees we were lucky enough to buy this year, coffees we had no direct connection wish in the past. We tend to buy from the Farmers Cooperative Societies (\"FCS\"), and still do. But buying from a single estate affords us a different and unique opportunity to select coffee that we can trace back to its exact provenance, whereas with the FCS's, you're buying a blend of hundreds and sometimes thousands of small holders. This is certainly not a bad thing as some of our finest Kenyas are through FCS's, just different. We still turn to the coops for the majority of our coffee, but are hoping to continue to cultivate buying relationships with a small number of Kenyan small estates as well. For a washed coffee, this Fram Farm lot produced a lot more chaff than I was expecting. It's not like a full natural coffee (dry process). But you'll likely notice a higher volume of silver skin shed during roasting and should keep that in mind when judging the physical color of the roasted coffee.","CuppingNotes":"The dry fragrance has a strong sweetness like maple, pungent burned sugars, with a whiff of lilac floral too in light roasts. Dark brown sugar smells emanate from the steam after pouring hot water, as does something like cooked raspberry compote. Sweetness is intense in the brewed coffee and, on its own, and along with intense fruited character, pushes Fram Farm's cupping score into the 90's. City and City+ roasts produce notes of ripe blueberry, black currant tea, and a note of date sugar. There's a very slight ferment flavor that reminds me of mead/fermented honey, and adds a complex wine note the the mix. A zesty citrus element emerges in light roasts, harnessing the tangy side of pink grapefruit juice. Deeper roast development casts a darker hue over the fruit notes, like dried berry and plum, and also brings out a soft bittersweetness in the background. Fram Farm is bodied and delicious, and I love how even at Full City roast level you can easily taste the dark fruit flavors that make this Fram Farm lot unique. ","Images":["https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/d03ea31552bd1b5f4cc7e80acbe033cb/k/e/kenya-kiambu-coffee-fram-farm-3_1.jpg","https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/d03ea31552bd1b5f4cc7e80acbe033cb/k/e/kenya-kiambu-coffee-fram-farm-5_7.jpg","https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/d03ea31552bd1b5f4cc7e80acbe033cb/k/e/kenya-kiambu-coffee-fram-farm-8_6.jpg"],"AdditionalAttributes":{"Appearance":".4 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen","Arrival date":"May 2021 Arrival","Bag size":"60 KG","Cultivar Detail":"SL-28","Drying Method":"Raised Bed Sun-Dried","Farm Gate":"Yes","Grade":"AB","Lot size":"37","Packaging":"GrainPro Liner","Processing":"Wet Process (Washed)","Region":"Kiambu, Muranga","Roast Recommendations":"City to Full City","Type":"Farm Gate"}}

The wet mill is very old, built up in the late 1950's for members in the surrounding villages. Like most factories, the wet mill site is where farmers deliver whole coffee cherry to be processed through the wet mill, then dried before moving to dry milling facilities where the coffee is prepared for export. Riakiberu sits at roughly 1750 meters above sea level (some farmers at much higher elevations), and situated near the Ndurumo River from which they are able to channel fresh water to be used for wet processing, which is then re-circulated without being put back into the river. Riakiberu is part of the Kamacharia Farmers Cooperative Society who currently serves over 1500 farmer members. This is the peaberry selection, the small, round shaped beans that they separate by running through a series of vibrating screens. Some say that peaberries are sweeter, due to higher density. There may be some truth wrapped into this claim, but I wouldn't say that's always the case. We also bought the largest bean, AA separation, and found that they bothy had some restrained fruit, with tea-like flavors, and moderate acidity.","CuppingNotes":"The fruits in Riakiberu's cup are restrained, leaving a lot more room for intense sweetness to come through. In the dry fragrance, layers of unrefined sugars are woven through a patchwork of dark fruit and rindy citrus hints. The wet aroma lets off spice accent notes atop a solid core sweetness that hints at caramelized sugars and just a touch of bittersweet chocolate. As you move into tasting the brewed coffee at City level, the sweetness takes on more of a transparent characteristic, which makes me think of simple syrup, persistent, but much less \"pungent\" than say molasses or sugarcane juice. It helps to fill out some of the lighter fruit elements that crop up, like black currant and raisin. I roasted one batch to somewhere in between City+/Full City (about 25 - 27 degrees of development past the beginning of 1st crack), and along with dark berry accents, the sweetness takes on more complex sugar notes and cools to a really delicious caramel flavor that extends to the aftertaste. Riakiberu is brightest at City roast, no doubt about it. But some tannic brightness comes through in deeper roasts too.","Images":["https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/d03ea31552bd1b5f4cc7e80acbe033cb/k/e/kenya-green-coffee-farmers-muranga-5.jpg","https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/d03ea31552bd1b5f4cc7e80acbe033cb/k/e/kenya-green-coffee-farmers-muranga-3_1.jpg","https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/d03ea31552bd1b5f4cc7e80acbe033cb/k/e/kenya-green-coffee-farmers-muranga-6_1.jpg"],"AdditionalAttributes":{"Appearance":".4 d/300gr, 15 Peaberry Screen","Arrival date":"June 2021 Arrival","Bag size":"60 KG","Cultivar Detail":"SL-28, SL-34","Drying Method":"Raised Bed Sun-Dried","Farm Gate":"Yes","Grade":"Peaberry","Lot size":"32","Packaging":"GrainPro Liner","Processing":"Wet Process (Washed)","Region":"Muranga County","Roast Recommendations":"City to Full City","Type":"Farm Gate"}}

This peaberry lot is robust, fruited, and an intense coffee overall. The dry fragrance is perfumed with saturated smells that are both fruited and floral, like ripe peach, plum jam and more. The fruited scent is bolstered in wet aroma, accompanied by notes of maple sugar, and a perfumed concord grape note. As you can probably tell from the smells, this coffee has a complex, sweet cup profile built around a multiplicity of fruited characteristics that unfold as the coffee cools. The range of fruited notes is broad, with grape, blackberry, plum infused tea, and blood orange topping the list. Acidity pops in the lighter roast levels, alluding to brisk tea and the vibrance found in stone fruit juice.

While we tend to recommend light roasts for most of our Kenyas, the fruit in Ichuga's cup takes on darker fruit characteristics at Full City that, that when buttressed up against fruited chocolate roast flavors, reveals a delicious cup that's quite different from lighter roasts of the same coffee. I DO love light roasts of Ichuga too, and they're my preferred end of the recommended roast spectrum, channeling a light and bright flavor profile. But those after darker stone fruit flavors tempered by chocolate bittersweets ought to give this lot a run at Full City. Light City roasts are a different coffee altogether, yielding an outstanding berry-like acidic impression, along with a mix of tart and ripe fruit flavors like red currant and boysenberry. My knowledge of wine is extremely limited, but there's a flavor in this coffee that reminds me of certain types of Zinfandel wine, with fruit notes that are ripe, and almost jammy in flavor.

All others were mixed to form \"Sana'ani coffee\" with decidedly mixed outcomes. But coffee in Bani Matari is a bit different, tall old-growth trees that appear like a fruit orchard than a typical coffee farm (well, NO coffee production in Yemen looks like a coffee farm anywhere else!). This lot was secured through Fatoum Muslot, who took over the family coffee business started by her father back in the 1950s. They've long exported Yemeni coffee, and since Fatoum has started managing the group, she has worked to implement practices such as more stringent hand sorting and using Ecotact storage bags in order to directly affect their coffee's overall quality. We're quite pleased with the physical condition of both coffees we bought from Fatoum this year, the lack of underripe coffee and shipping in Ecotact liners has really benefitted the resulting cup quality. During their long history in the coffee trade they've forged longstanding connections with farming groups in several growing regions, and because of these connections, are able to buy coffee in a more direct way. This lot is made up of coffee from roughly 100 farmers in Bani Matari, who on average have 1000 trees planted on less than 1/2 hectare of land. Altitude is extremely high, starting around 2000 meters and stretching upwards of 2400 meters above sea level. This It's been a few years now since we've picked up Yemeni coffee, not necessarily by choice, but mainly due to the difficulties exporting from a country at war. The situation there is still quite dire, and I'm amazed that anything is making it out of the country. Read our interview with Fatoum Mouslot from 2020. ","CuppingNotes":"Matari has a rustic appeal with syrupy sweetness, freeze-dried fruit, earth and spice notes, and a lot more. We certainly give them a pass in cleanliness given the long road Yemeni coffee takes before final export, but it is not a stretch to say they are some of the most complex coffees out there. The dry fragrance produces smells of dried banana, cinnamon and sugar, nut brittle, sandalwood and leather. The wet aromatics go from wood-spice incense to brown bread, as well as a scent of stewed stone fruits. Matari shape-shifts across roast levels and as the coffee temperature comes down a bit. This coffee is rustic for sure all along the roast spectrum. Bittersweet, and earth toned, the flavor profiles bring to mind the sweet aroma of leather, with spices overhead like sandalwood oil, chai spice tea, and chicory root. The coffee also reveals a delicious fruited side, with glimpses of natural dried apricot, freeze-dried berry, as well as an interesting cooked rhubarb note (even a bit on the 'tart' side). Taking development to Full City, a dried fig hint quickly gives way to rustic cocoa powder bittering, and a pipe tobacco accent leaves a lasting impression in the finish. Yemeni coffees need rest after roasting, giving the coffee time to off gas, allowing flavors to coalesce. They're certainly aromatic at 12 hours or 24 hours, but really develop at 72+ hours of rest after roasting. This is especially true for espresso. ","Images":["https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/d03ea31552bd1b5f4cc7e80acbe033cb/y/e/yemen-coffee-matari-1_3.jpg","https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/d03ea31552bd1b5f4cc7e80acbe033cb/y/e/yemen-coffee-matari-3_2.jpg","https://www.sweetmarias.com/media/catalog/product/cache/d03ea31552bd1b5f4cc7e80acbe033cb/y/e/yemen-coffee-matari-4_3.jpg"],"AdditionalAttributes":{"Appearance":"1+ d/300gr, 14+ screen - I'm grading conservatively to temper expectations, but this coffee is a really nice sort for Yemen.
