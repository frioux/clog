Between a loan from a local coop bank, and earnest money the 180 farm members pulled together, they were able to get enough cash to build out the Kedamai washing station infrastructure including a Penagos 2500 coffee depulper. Last year (their first year) they expected to produce roughly 700 bags of coffee, and this year exceeded that mark. Being newer, they are receiving training from surrounding mill managers on things like operating their depulper, grading coffee cherry, and general management of the workflow at the station site. The water for processing is very clean because they are taking it from a stream above the washing station, not from the river below. One thing I noticed is that the coffee is a fairly wide range of screen sizes, from as small as 15 (maybe even 14), to some pretty large beans that look to be around 19 screen. ","CuppingNotes":"Kedamai fits right in with our nicer Western Ethiopian coffees, a cup profile with transparent sweetness and marked by juicy stone fruit and subtle floral character too. City and City+ roasting showcase a peach juice aspect too that I think carries a bit more vibrance and 'pep' than some of the others. Aromatically speaking, Kedamai is marked by stone fruit and heady wafts of sugar browning sweetness, faint floral and mulling spice accents coming into view after pouring the hot water. In one sense the brewed coffee of Kedamai has a robust quality in terms of body and syrupy sweetness, but it also displays some delicate perfumed top notes too. The cooled cup offers glimpses of orange blossom florals and peach tea. I don't know what it is about the coffees from the West, but so many of them yield syrupy-sweet stone fruit flavors, and Kedami does just that, with notes of apricot nectar, and peach preserves. Sugar browning sweetness is stronger at City+, but thankfully does little to tone down the fruited intensity, and body seems a little more dense with this incremental degree of roast. I'm going to recommend keeping Kedamai light and bright for brewed coffee in order to keep from diminishing the perfumed qualities found at City and City+ roast levels. But for espresso, we found that Full City roasts are outta sight. Acidity is more moderate than some of our other Ethiopian coffees, and flavors of orange citrus fold in nicely with persistent bittersweet chocolate roast tones and stone fruit accents.","Images":null,"AdditionalAttributes":{"Appearance":".2 d/300gr, 15 -17 Screen","Arrival date":"October 2021 Arrival","Bag size":"60 KG","Cultivar Detail":"Heirloom Cultivars","Drying Method":"Raised Bed Sun Dried","Farm Gate":"Yes","Grade":"Grade 1","Lot size":"25","Packaging":"GrainPro Liner","Processing":"Wet Process (Washed)","Recommended for Espresso":"Yes","Region":"Agaro Town, Jimma","Roast Recommendations":"City to Full City","Type":"Farm Gate"}}

He is the older brother to Esmael Hassan, who you may remember as the producer of another Guji coffee we've also carried, Kayon Mountain. \"Dabaye\" is the name of the kebele where this Hambela station is located (a town, more or less). We were lucky enough to be hosted at this station on our December 2018 visit, camping out in a pair of military tents replete with cots, overlooking the couple hundred drying tables below us. Kedir is an incredibly proficient and capable engineer as well as coffee farmer, and built the entire Hambela station in one season. You wouldn't know this, as it's visually apparent everything was built with high processing standards, and with efficiency in mind. Of course he did not complete Hambela on his own, and thanks to his long standing connection with the the people in this area, he had much needed community support. Hambela sits at 1816 meters above sea level, and coffee is grown as high as 2100 meters. They mostly buy coffee from farmers in the surrounding kebeles of Buliye, Wamena, Borticha, Dari Rogicha and Dabaye, of course.","CuppingNotes":"Delicious and delicate, this wet-processed lot from Hambela Dabaye packs impressive sweetness, and blossoms with Guji floral cup characteristics. The dry fragrance smells very tea-like and floral, a note of loose leaf green tea, jasmine pearls, and a lingering honey sweet note. A more intense sweetness emerges from the wetted grounds, and running my spoon through the coffee crust released a potent mix of partially raw sugars and fragrant florals, as well as a hint of grapefruit. City roasts produce layers of sweetness that, when peeled back, reveal raw sugars, as well as pectin-type, fruited flavors that shape shift a little as the coffee cools. One element that is resolute from start to finish are the floral characteristics. Can we just talk about how perfumed this cup is? Really, the jasmine aroma is intense, leaving quite an impression on the cup profile, tasting akin to fresh Gesha coffee, or a super floral Yirga Cheffe cup. It's really special, and it's the note that stands out on first sip, and sticks with you after finishing the cup! The sweetness underneath is a bit like demerara sugar (unrefined cane sugar with some molasses intact), with an aromatic note of raw honey, and fruited flavor of white grape juice. As the coffee cools down some, I pick up on more fruited flavor notes like lychee fruit, soft citrus, and a pink bubblegum note. So much of the coffee character can be described as light and delicate, and you should give it a light treatment in the roaster too. Pulling 1 minute and 30 seconds after the start of 1st Crack is not too soon! That's where I stopped my first roast and I've been enjoying the most amazing pour over brews.","Images":null,"AdditionalAttributes":{"Appearance":".2 d/300gr, 14-16 Screen","Arrival date":"May 2022 Arrival","Bag size":"60 KG","Cultivar Detail":"Heirloom Cultivars","Drying Method":"Raised Bed Sun-Dried","Farm Gate":"Yes","Grade":"Grade 1","Lot size":"100","Packaging":"GrainPro Liner","Processing":"Wet Process (Washed)","Region":"Dame Dabaye, Hambela Wamena, Guji","Roast Recommendations":"City to City+","Type":"Farm Gate"}}

The factory has the good fortune of being connected to the national electric grid, and washing resources are plentiful with the nearby Nyamindi river as the source. Kamwangi is part of the New Ngariama Farmers Cooperative Society (\"FCS\" - Kainamui is also under the New Ngariama umbrella of coops). Membership has reached nearly 1,000 farmers at Kamwangi, each with a tiny plot of coffee, generally 200 - 300 trees. Kamwangi farmers grow primarily SL-28, SL-34, and Ruiru 11 cultivars, benefitting from the red volcanic soils of Mt Kenya, and most stretch above 1800 meters above sea level. These factories are basically small washing stations set up in a particular area and are allied with a larger cooperative society - the FCS. Factories have wet mills, washing/fermenting channels, and raised beds where the coffees are basically processed all the way down to dried parchment (being meticulously sorted along the way). Kamwangi has a water recirculation system set up, as well as eight waste water soaking pits to help minimize the environmental impact. ","CuppingNotes":"There is intense citrus and brown sugar sweetness to the dry grounds of Kamwangi AB, with a really nice note of orange spice tea. It's a perfumed fragrance at City roast level, with sweet fruits and mulling spice, along with the raw sugar smells. The wet grounds of City roasts have a more complex sweetness of unrefined sugars and honey, a fragrant orange peel note released in the steam, and herbal and tropical fruit hints that blend to something like pineapple sage. Citrus flavors resonate in Kamwangi's cup, both in terms of flavor and acidity. At City roast level, the bright acidity is supported by flavors of orange spritzer, and sweetened lemonade (think Country Time lemonade, rather than fresh squeezed). The acidic impression is on the refreshing side rather than grabby, too. The flavor profile expands a bit as the coffee cools, and includes hints of orange tea, pomegranate, and candied citrus peel at City. Our City+ roast had more of a red berry fruit hue, with flavors of juicy boysenberry and blackberry topping the list.

Factories are basically what we call a wet mill, and is where farmers bring coffee cherry fruit for processing in Kenya. The Thunguri coop is part of the Kibirigwi Farmers Cooperative Society (\"FCS\"), a parent society whose other Factories we've bought coffee from and offered multiple times in our 15 year history at Sweet Maria's. Coffees are wet processed at the factories, then separated by size, and in this case, shape. The most common sizes we see are AA, and AB, which refers to coffees that fall between a range of 17/64\" to 19/64\", and 15/64\" to 17/64\" respectively. Peaberries are the small, rounded coffee that occur when only one of the two embryos germinates and grows into a single, round coffee bean, rather than two that have a single flat side from sharing the space. Peaberries make up a very small part of the Kenya harvest (roughly 5-10%) and so the bag amounts tend to be very small as well. This lot is only 9 bags, for example. We're never really sure which of these coffee sizes will shine brightest, and in this case, Thunguri's peaberry \"outturn\" stood out amongst the rest.","CuppingNotes":"The dry fragrance produces focused sweetness at City roast level, with a subtle citrus feature wrapped in maple, and muscovado sugars. Aromatically, I picked up on a smell of citrus, more like dried/candied lemon peel, and with sweet layers of white frosting and cinnamon raisin bread. If 'light and bright' type Kenyas are your preference, Thunguri will satisfy with fruited brightness that rides the line between a citric impression and berry juice. A soft lemonade note comes through as the coffee cools, along with notes of blackberry, red currant jelly, and orange. The cup is graced with fragrant spice notes as well, and drew comparisons to Darjeeling tea, candy coated cardamom seeds, and a floral hint of rose potpourri. It's kind of surprising how roasting just a shade darker unlocks more of the berry fruit characteristics too, with flavors of blackberry pancake syrup, and mixed berry jam. Full City roasts offer something much different, a lot less fruited cup, showing  Scharffen Berger type bittersweet chocolate, juicy mouthfeel, and dark berry characteristics are more of an aromatic feature rather than flavor.

Wet mills are referred to as \"factories\" in Kenya, each serving a particular micro-region, and often associated with a few other cooperatives that fall under a conglomerate umbrella that is the \"Farmers Cooperative Society\". Gathaithi station is where the local members deliver their whole coffee cherry for processing: first pulping in a 3-disc \"Kenya\" style pulping machine, fermenting overnight, then washing away the cherry skins in clean water, and then soaking once more in fresh water before the parchment coffee is laid out to dry on raised drying beds. There are currently 1250 coop members, and the average altitude is 1700 meters above sea level, though farms fall on both side of that number. Grade doesn't necessarily correlate to actual cup quality (until you get into C, TT, and below), but we did find this particular AA size separation to stand out from the rest.

What a great pour over brew Gathaithi makes, with flavors of fruit juices, mouth-cleansing acidic impression, and transparent finish. Our City roast was undoubtedly the brightest brew, giving the perception of citric tartness, a mouthfeel that helps organize the wide array of fruited notes like plump red grape, cranberry jelly, black currant, tart rhubarb, and pear juice to name a few. Light roasts brings forth a wave of citrus flavors, and a flavor mix of orange and cherry offers a refreshing aspect, along with simple syrup type sweetness. The finish from light to dark roasting (we roasted to around Full City, 34 degrees of development post first crack) shows lasting sweetness, with complex baking spices lingering in the aroma and aftertaste, along with a pleasant tannic bittering. Fruit flavors and acidity are altered by darker roast development, and we found that at Full City there was berry-like brightness, and flavors of dark grape are a bit more prevalent, along with a note of red plum, and roast bittering in the aftertaste.

The Korgua Estate resides in Nebilyer District, Central Highland region of Papua New Guinea. Now run by Brian Leahy, the farm was founded by Brian's father Dan and Uncle Mick, two well-known Australian explorers (their early films and photos being the basis for the Australian documentary, \"First Contact\"). Korgua Estate sits at about 1400 meters above sea level and is planted mostly in older Bourbon and Typica cultivars. It's a wet processed coffee, meaning the coffee cherry and much of the fruit are stripped from the seed using depulping machinery, and then the seed still covered in sticky mucilage is submerged in water tanks where it ferments overnight, breaking down the remaining outer layer of fruit. Now this is an X grade coffee, which is technically 'lower' than the top grades like A and AX. But tasting it blind side by side with the top grades, it was clearly the superior cup, more fruited and sweet in a way that set it apart from the rest.","CuppingNotes":"This lot from Korgua Estate is an X grade, which technically is considered a lower level than AA and A grades from Papua New Guinea (PNG). But there are cases like this where, in cupping all of them side by side, X Grade has the fruited sweetness the others lack. The AA was pleasant enough, but really lacked character, whereas X was sweet and fruit-laden. Toffee and caramel sweet smells transfer from freshly ground coffee to wet aromatics, as well as fruited notes that seem to gain momentum after pouring hot water. The coffee extracts medium body across a range of roasts, and presents moderate acidity when kept to the lighter end of the spectrum. (Body is heightened when using full immersion methods like French Press, especially with City+ and Full City roasts where sweetness plays as prominent a role as bittering coffee roast tone!).

The coffee processed at the mill are from smaller coffee plantations in the area situated at just under 1600 meters above sea level on the low end. It's a wet processed coffee, meaning the coffee cherry and much of the fruit are stripped from the seed using depulping machinery, and then the green coffee seed, still covered in sticky mucilage, is submerged in water tanks where it ferments overnight, breaking down the remaining outer layer of fruit. The physical preparation of this coffee is decent, however, I did find a few partial quaker beans in my roasted coffee. Quakers are unripe coffee that are easy to spot when roasted as they remain light tan no matter how dark you roast your coffee. Not all beans with a lighter color variance are quakers! And similarly, not all quakers have the same affect on flavor. Coffee that is nearly ripe will be a little darker in color than a true, full quaker, and taste much closer to the fully ripe coffee. A few partial quakers like these are likely to go undetected in a full brew batch. There's also very little silver skin left on the seeds, which makes judging roast development by physical color shade fairly easy.","CuppingNotes":"This Papua New Guinea coffee has a nice sweet scent that transfers from freshly ground coffee to wet aromatics that, with convincing chocolate roast smells, have a smell of bittersweet confections. This carries through to the brewed coffee, and City+ roasting provides dark sugar and toffee sweet flavors with a 'toasted' note, like torched sugar. Kuta Waghi shows understated fruit aspects as it cools, a faint hint of prune, wisps of dried citrus peel that get the most attention at lighter roast levels, though are still very low in the profile. The aftertastes shows ample bittering that points to tannic tea, and unsweetened baking chocolate depending on how dark you roast it.

All others were mixed to form \"Sana'ani coffee\" with decidedly mixed outcomes. But coffee in Bani Matari is a bit different, tall old-growth trees that appear like a fruit orchard than a typical coffee farm (well, NO coffee production in Yemen looks like a coffee farm anywhere else!). This lot was secured through Fatoum Muslot, who took over the family coffee business started by her father back in the 1950s. They've long exported Yemeni coffee, and since Fatoum has started managing the group, she has worked to implement practices such as more stringent hand sorting and using Ecotact storage bags in order to directly affect their coffee's overall quality. We're quite pleased with the physical condition of both coffees we bought from Fatoum this year, the lack of underripe coffee and shipping in Ecotact liners has really benefitted the resulting cup quality. During their long history in the coffee trade they've forged longstanding connections with farming groups in several growing regions, and because of these connections, are able to buy coffee in a more direct way. This lot is made up of coffee from roughly 100 farmers in Bani Matari, who on average have 1000 trees planted on less than 1/2 hectare of land. Altitude is extremely high, starting around 2000 meters and stretching upwards of 2400 meters above sea level.

We certainly give them a pass in cleanliness given the long road Yemeni coffee takes before final export, but it is not a stretch to say they are some of the most complex coffees out there. The dry fragrance produces smells of dried banana, sweet squash, nut brittle, and aromatic sandalwood. The wet aroma has a nice balance of cocoa and fruit smells, earth-toned chocolates, and hints of stewed berry. Matari shape-shifts across roast levels and as the coffee temperature comes down a bit. While this coffee is rustic for sure, it's in a much cleaner camp relative to Yemeni coffee (at least in my experience). The coffee reveals a delicious fruited side, with glimpses of natural dried apricot, cooked berry reductions, and baked apple (even a bit on the 'tart' side of apple skin). The chocolate flavors are well defined, offset by molasses type sweetness, and aromatic hint of chai spice. Roasting to Full City, a dried fig hint quickly gives way to rustic cocoa powder bittering, and a pipe tobacco accent leaves a lasting impression in the finish. Yemeni coffees need rest after roasting, giving the coffee time to off gas, and allowing flavors to coalesce. They're certainly aromatic at 12 hours or 24 hours, but the depth of flavor really comes together with more like 72 hours rest after roasting. This is especially true for dark roasts, and roasts for espresso. ","Images":null,"AdditionalAttributes":{"Appearance":"1 d/300gr, 14+ screen - I'm grading conservatively to temper expectations, but this coffee is a really nice sort for Yemen.
