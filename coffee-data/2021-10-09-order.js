It's on the restrained side in terms of fruit, but has a delicious smelling chocolate/banana mixture that leads into some molasses type sugar sweetness. Pouring hot water on the ground coffee, however, stirs up enticing smells of chocolate-dipped dried mango, ripe fruit characteristics, and intense cocoa roast at Full City. My City roast popped when brewed, with a fruit salad of flavor notes like peach, mango, and honey dew melon. The coffee has moderate acidity that comes off like fresh fruits (stone fruit came to mind for me). Light roasts are very aromatic too, and give off some passion fruit florals as it cools. More moderate roasts add a delicious chocolate overlay to the fruit-forward profile, enhancing bass notes like cacao nibs, and also rounding off acidity some.","Images":null,"AdditionalAttributes":{"Appearance":".6 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen","Arrival date":"August 2021 Arrival","Bag size":"60 KG","Cultivar Detail":"Heirloom Cultivars","Drying Method":"Raised Bed Sun-Dried","Farm Gate":"Yes","Grade":"Grade 1","Lot size":"100","Packaging":"GrainPro Liner","Processing":"Dry Process (Natural)","Region":"Dambi Uddo, Shakisso, Guji Zone","Roast Recommendations":"City to Full City","Type":"Farm Gate"}}

The dry fragrance has sweet notes of caramel and honey, a hint of creamy chocolate (I wrote \"Oreo\", actually), and dried apricot. The wet aroma produces low-intensity berry accents in the steam, with nice, clean dark chocolate bittersweet notes. In the brew, I'm struck by the level of acidity in light City roasts.

These lots are made up of coffee from several hundred different farmers, most with only a couple hundred coffee trees or less. The people in this region are known as Guji Oromo, and coffee farming has been a core part of the culture in the highland areas for many years. It's a distinct coffee from Yirga Cheffe, and Sidamo. Geographically, culturally, and in terms of cup flavors, these southern coffees have a different flavor profile while maintaining the same general characteristics; citrus and floral accents, a lively cup character. This lot was purchased from a family run wet mill near Hambela. They have their own wet and dry milling equipment, handling all post-harvest milling themselves, oversee quality management, and preparation for export. Like most of the country, the farm is planted in regionally distinct local strains of coffees that have spread from the wild forest plants of western Ethiopia, to Harar in the East and to the southern districts like Guji. This particular lot was wet-processed, meaning that after the cherry is removed from the seed, the sticky mucilage layer that surrounds the bean is removed after fermenting for 24-36 hours in water (this varies from region to region), before then being removed and laid out to dry on raised drying tables. ","CuppingNotes":"Goro Bedessa is a very nice example of a wet process Ethiopia Guji coffee, uniquely honeyed sweetness, and stone fruit accent notes that in some ways put it in a category with some of Western Ethiopian coffees. The dry fragrance is laced with a baking spice hint atop a scent of red honey, mild roast bittering, and a light floral note. The wet aroma has perfumed sweetness that goes from dark honey to brown sugar, and the floral aroma makes more of an impression at this stage, indicating a bit of star jasmine. The brew is delicious at City roast level, with surprisingly well-developed sweetness that shows flavors of clover honey. Moving through the cup, I get a range of yellow stone fruit hints, aspects of apricot, peach and nectarine specifically. Fruited flavors are mere accents when the cup is hot, but come a little closer to the front, and more attention grabbing, as the coffee cools down in temperature. Goro Bedessa's acidic impression is mouth-cleansing, with aspects of white grape juice, and a black tea-like mouthfeel is emphasized by a note of English Breakfast tea. Florals are soft, but add perfumed aromatics to the profile, letting on to traces of jasmine and honeysuckle, as well as a hint of rue in the finish. Full City roasts are quite pungent, typical dark roast notes in a way, and it loses a lot of the nuance - hence the \"City to City+\" roast recommendation.","Images":null,"AdditionalAttributes":{"Appearance":".2 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen","Arrival date":"August 2021 Arrival","Bag size":"60 KG","Cultivar Detail":"Heirloom Cultivars","Drying Method":"Raised Bed Sun-Dried","Farm Gate":"Yes","Grade":"Grade 1","Lot size":"80","Packaging":"GrainPro Liner","Processing":"Wet Process (Washed)","Region":"Goro Bedessa, Guji Zone","Roast Recommendations":"City to City+","Type":"Farm Gate"}}

We were lucky enough to stay the night at this site amidst the beautiful surrounding on our December 2018 visit, sleeping in a pair of military tents replete with cots that overlooked the couple hundred drying tables below us. Kedir is a proficient and capable engineer as well as coffee farmer, and built the entire Hambela station in one season. You wouldn't know this, as it's visually apparent everything was built with high processing standards, and efficiency in mind. Of course he did not complete Hambela on his own, and thanks to his long standing connection with the the people in this area, he had much needed community support. Hambela sits at 1816 meters above sea level, and coffee is grown as high as 2100 meters.

The aroma has a strawberry jam element, fruit/berry and caramelizing sugar sweet smells lace the aromatically potent steam, and a soft floral hint is released on the break. City and City+ roasts are pretty amazing when brewed as pour over. The cup is remarkably clean considering how this coffee is processed. Berry notes are evident right off the bat, but don't overpower the cup. Strawberry jam, nectarine, and berry-like brightness illuminate the brewed coffee, and connect to floral aromatics that touch on jasmine, but also display elements of ripe fruits. Full City roasts are also delicious, but trade vibrance and clear fruit flavors for pleasantly bittering roast tone more dried fruit characteristics. If you're looking for a dry process Ethiopia espresso, this is the one to pick up in my opinion. Body is weighty and thick, the chocolate flavor is infused with berry type fruit, and much of the acidic vibrance is toned down in the darker roast levels. But because I think this is too wild for the average espresso drinker, I'm withholding the espresso recommendation from the coffee \"specs\" tab and short description.","Images":null,"AdditionalAttributes":{"Appearance":".8 d/300gr, 14-17 Screen - mostly partial quakers","Arrival date":"August 2021 Arrival","Bag size":"60 KG","Cultivar Detail":"Heirloom Cultivars","Drying Method":"Raised Bed Sun-Dried","Farm Gate":"Yes","Grade":"Grade 1","Lot size":"120","Packaging":"GrainPro Liner","Processing":"Dry Process (Natural)","Region":"Dabaye Kebele, Shakiso, Guji","Roast Recommendations":"City to Full City - lighter roasts will showcase the floral and fruit best","Type":"Farm Gate"}}

It comes from a privately run mill in Kecho Anderacha, called \"Telila\", named after the owner's late father. He got his start in the coffee trade through his father, whose long history working for an early exporter in Addis called Besse afforded him the opportunity to branch off into his own, smaller export business that has slowly grown into what it is today. The Telila washing station is outfitted with a five disc pulper that's fairly unique, and produced locally in Addis Ababa. After the outer cherry is removed, the coffee is fermented with clean water in cement tanks overnight, before moving to long channels where the remaining fruit is washed away. Next, the parchment-covered coffee is moved to raised drying beds constructed of bamboo where it will dry for upwards of 2 full weeks (you can see them in the second photo, both constructed, as well as tall bamboo stacks that will be used to build more during the harvest season). The coffees that went into this particular lot were procured from areas such as Genji Challa, Kecho Anderacha, Yukiro, and more, and the cup quality is right in line with the cooperative coffees we buy who share those same names. Altitude in these regions ranges from about 1900 to 2100 meters above sea level, and most farmers have less than 1 hectare of coffee that they tend to.","CuppingNotes":"Telila has a delicate cup profile, with mild floral aroma, atop sweetness that hints at fruited types and simple sugars.

Pouring hot water raises a very nice honey smell, filling the steam with a perfumed sweetness that envelopes the slight fruited accents. City and City+ roasts make a stellar pour over. In the cup, the sweetness has elements of brown sugar candies, and aromatic sugars like fresh pressed cane juice. The cup is sweet from start to finish, and in between we catch glimpses of cranberry, and blackberry, an orange creamsicle hint in the aftertaste. There are tea-like aspects as well that serve to underline the acidic impression, which is quite lovely, and bright in Telila. Tasting this side-by-side with Genji Challa, another coffee from the same mill, it's hard to miss all the flavor similarities.

His farm sits just above 1850 meters above sea level, and while it wasn't clear what cultivars he's growing, there looked to be Bourbon types planted. His trees looked to be very healthy, and when we visited a couple of years back, he had 8 year old plantings offset by newere 2 year old plants. throughout his farm. Herculano's coffee stood out amongst the other Xinabajuls as being more fruited. I wouldn't call it \"fruity\", but rather accented by a fairly wide swath of juicy fruit flavors. Tuiloj coffee farmers are mostly small scale, and Herculano is no exception. We managed to buy 7 bags of coffee from him this year, so quite limited. \"Xinabajul\" is the name of the original Huehuetenango town, and also the name we've used for a project we've had going in the Huehue highlands for almost a decade.

I reviewed this next to another Xinabajul coffee that scored nicely, and this lot just blew it away. The smells are sweet with caramel type sugars and dark fruit accents. The wet aromatics are laced with hints of mixed berry and honey, a hint of pineapple cooked with brown sugar in there too. The cup at City roast shows some of that pineapple type fruit flavor in the cup too, though I think it's fair to say it's raw sugar sweetness that is at the center of the flavor profile. I'm picking up mostly on unrefined sugar types like demurara, turbinado, maybe sucanat too, with that aromatic molasses in the mix. Light roasts are bright with aspects of lemon tea and green apple. It's a really elegant Guatemalan brew, though also has hefty cocoa and fruit to offer when roasted dark too. But sticking with City-City+ roasts for a minute, look for notes of nectarine, pluot, and a tart hint of muscat grape amidst the dominant, complex sugar sweetness. Full City roasts pull out more of a dark grape hint, though filtered through bittersweet flavors of powdered drinking chocolate and cacao bar.

Chinga Factory was the second mill to be developed under Othaya umbrella in 1960. \"Factories\" are essentially small washing stations aligned with a particular \"society\" in Kenya, what we would call a \"cooperative\". We return to the societies who seem to regularly produce some of the best Kenya coffees, and each year we come across societies that are new to us as well. Being one of the older Kenya FCS, we are well aware of the quality coming out of Othaya, and have had the good fortune to buy a few stellar lots the past two years. We bought three lots from the Chinga station this year alone including this AB lot, one each Peaberry and AA. This coffee's sweetness just blew us away, marked by some lovely fruit hints, and vibrant, bright acidity too. It was purchased direct, not through the Kenya auction system, so we could avoid the risk of losing it. To do this we pay a price that is higher than what the top auction bid might be, but it means we get the exact lot we want.","CuppingNotes":"Chinga has such a sweet smell to it, with dried fruited sweetness in the grinds, like raisin and date. Fruit and raw sugar smell are a bit more potent in the wet aroma, and culminate a steam infused with cinnamon-spiced raisin, dried plum, and potent caramel candy sweetness. I wouldn't call the cup fruit-forward, but the caramel-like sweetness that's prevalent at City and City+ yields to some really interesting fruited top notes as the coffee cools off some. The interplay of caramelized sugar and fruit flavors brings out a cooked fruit flavor that brought to mind peach pie filling, and berry compote. There's a butterscotch note that emerges and has floral potency, adding another layer to the sweetness. I picked up on some hints of apricot nectar, and orange zest in the middle and finish too. Acidity is a real highlight in light roasts, a lemon acidic impression makes its mark on the complex cup profile.
