Yirga Cheffe coffee farmer Tariku Mengesha has a few small coffee farms scattered throughout the kebele of Chelchele, totaling just under 13 hectares between them. When he's not managing the farms with his 10 children, Tariku operates a few other washing stations and processing sites, buying and processing coffee cherry from the hundreds of small holder farmers in the areas he operates. This lot is made up of only his personal farm coffee, and is dry process, meaning the seed is dried inside the whole cherry. This is the oldest processing method, and often leads to fruitier cup flavors, big body, and rounded acidity (certainly can be said for this lot!). The Mengesha farms span an altitude range of 2020 to 2100 meters above sea level, extremely high for any coffee origin! High altitude slows maturation and increases coffee bean density, which correlates to higher probability of sweetness and acidity, and also can affect the size of the beans. You'll find small beans in this lot, the smallest being 14 screen (measured in 1/64 in.). Behmor users might want to give their roast batch a shake in the drum before roasting in order to shake free any of the smallest beans that might fall through the screen grid. ","CuppingNotes":"I'm finding this dry process Mengesha Farm to be potent and floral in a fruity kind of way, with complex blueberry flavors that are highly coveted! Being a natural/dry process, fruits are a big part of the flavor profile, and they have aromatic potency that, say, a really ripe berry gives off. It's the kind of feature that pushes the \"wow\" factor in a dry process coffee like this one! The fragrance and aroma have a scent of dried blueberry, perhaps a bit more like cooked berry reduction at City+, along with pungent sweet smells of molasses, cooked sugars, and fruits that have a winey ripeness, but never over the edge. Even at Full City there's a strong presence of berry fruit aromatics, along with an attractive scent of fine dark chocolate. The cup leads with a sweet blueberry note that connects to a fruit-floral aroma by orange acidic impression. Tart aspects grace the lighter roasts and bring to mind citrus pith and berry skins. The cup profile shows elements of cooked stone fruits, and a creamy banana flavor that at City+ is a bit like chocolate-dipped banana. City roasts yield the most floral cups, with hints of jasmine, ripe strawberry, and more. The cup cools nicely, offering up flavors of mixed berry jam, blackberry Kiefer, and a berry hard candy note that impacts the finishing aroma. There's a hint of rustic cocoa in the long finish too - it's a natural after all - but that's easily overshadowed by another sip!","Images":null,"AdditionalAttributes":{"Appearance":".6 d/300gr, 14-17 Screen","Arrival date":"July 2022 Arrival","Bag size":"60 KG","Cultivar Detail":"Heirloom Cultivars","Drying Method":"Raised Bed Sun-Dried","Farm Gate":"Yes","Grade":"Grade 1","Lot size":"160","Packaging":"GrainPro Liner","Processing":"Dry Process (Natural)","Region":"Chelchele, Yirga Cheffe","Roast Recommendations":"City to Full City","Type":"Farm Gate"}}

Duromina was formed with the help of a non-government organization that not only coordinated agronomists and managers for each of the coops they work with, but also had a business adviser assigned that helped the cooperative manage their debt, re-invest in quality improvements at the mill, and verifies distribution of income to all members. This is a key position; I have never known a coop to get this kind of expert advice from outside ... not in Africa at least. A cooperative can make all kinds of quality improvements, turn out fantastic coffee, and sink deeper in debt all the while. Cooperatives often fail to return a fair and full amount of payment to their farmer-members. Often this is from poor management, and sometimes from graft as well. Duromina \"graduated\" from the NGO program a few years bvack and operates independently with the oversight of a farmer-member leadership group. Duromina is in the Goma region of Agaro Woreda, with farm altitudes between 1900 to 2100 meters. The name, chosen by the farmers, has quite a straight-forward meaning: it roughly translates as \"Make More Money!\" With the solid price Duromina receives for their coffee, and their success reinvesting in the Goma area, the name has proved quite appropriate. NPR did an interesting audio piece on this coop a few years back: Cinderella Story.","CuppingNotes":"The dry fragrance is front-loaded with a sweetness of darker toned honey, with a brown sugar accent adding depth, along with peach/stone fruits, and a whiff of orange. Adding the hot water brings up a scent of dark honey, and the wetted crust is saturated with simple brown sugars, fruits more of a background attribute at this stage. The cup flavors echo the aromatics in multi-layered fruit tones, with subtle floral hints, and not-so-subtle underlying sweetness. City roasts make for the brightest cups, the tangy orange citrus felt at the sides of your tongue see sweet relief from dense raw honey sweetness. Fruited flavors accent the base sweetness as the coffee cools, and my list included fresh red apple, orange marmalade, peach, and pleasantly bittering aspect of stone fruit skins in the aftertaste. A floral aroma is most prominent in light roasts and shows elements of floral peach, and also a rue herbal hint. Body is boosted with darker roasting, but Duromina showed tactile appeal at every roast level we tasted. City+ roasting brings out a somewhat subtle chocolate tone, and fruited flavors thankfully are not compromised, pointing to natural dried date and apricot. The acidity level is moderate in comparison to some of the Yirga Cheffe's we've carried, but structuring none the less. I experimented with taking a roast into 2nd Crack, but thought the flavors fell flat, with roast bittering overpowering the cup. City/City+ is where I think Duromina brews best, and Full City being the darkest roasts where you can still expect some of that fruited sweetness to shine through. ","Images":null,"AdditionalAttributes":{"Appearance":".2 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen","Arrival date":"June 2022 Arrival","Bag size":"60 KG","Certifications":"","Cultivar Detail":"Heirloom Cultivars","Drying Method":"Raised Bed Sun-Dried","Farm Gate":"Yes","Grade":"Grade 1","Lot size":"80","Packaging":"GrainPro Liner","Processing":"Wet Process (Washed)","Region":"Goma, Agaro","Roast Recommendations":"City to Full City","Type":"Farm Gate, Organic/Fair Trade Cert."}}

It's on the smaller size in comparison, both in terms of physical and membership numbers, with 80 local farmers making up its base. Beshasha town has very good altitude, registering at just under 2100 meters above sea level. It is conveniently situated along the side of one of the main dirt road that runs through town, affording good access for moving coffee on and off the site. As a matter of fact, we made an unplanned visit to Birbirsa in 2019 on our way to another coop. The colorful sign, and colorfully dressed manager Mohammed, drew us in like a beacon on the side of the dusty road (that's Mohammed in the beautiful green shirt and tie in front of Birbirsa sign). During our tour of the site, we saw that the cherry selection looked great, and have hoped for an opportunity to buy their coffee ever since. It took a few years, but we finally were able to facilitate samples this harvest, and based on what we saw on our visit, were not surprised by the high quality they sent. They only produce dry process at the moment, which is fine by us. They focus on doing one thing, and they do it very well!","CuppingNotes":"Most of our dry process coffees come from southern regions like Yirga Cheffe, so we are particularly pleased to have this amazing coffee from Western Jimma on offer. The dry fragrance was fruited at all the roast levels we tested, even in a dark Full City (not quite 2nd cracks). Our City and City+ roasts brought out smells of boysenberry, pineapple, orange-infused chocolate, and a super sweet honey smell in the dry grounds. Aroma shows a bounty of fragrant fruits, darker stone fruits like plum, cooked peach, and some dried mango and papaya. Lighter roasts brew a bright fruited cup, with peach tones similar to some other Western Ethiopian coffees on our menu, but with a bit more pulpy/fruit nectar aspects behind it that add to a syrupy mouthfeel. For dry process, Birbirsa is quite clean with regards to sweetness and acidity, and the cooling cup yields a long list of flavor notes like boysenberry, peach flavored syrup (Torani type), stone fruit cobbler, cooked sugars, and a Tangerine note up front that fades to rindy citrus peel and cocoa nib bittering in the aftertaste. Full City roasts round off the vibrance a bit, and you're left with a cup profile of bittersweet chocolates, and blueberry note that leaves a lasting impression on the finish.","Images":null,"AdditionalAttributes":{"Appearance":".8 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen","Arrival date":"June 2022 Arrival","Bag size":"60 KG","Certifications":"","Cultivar Detail":"Heirloom Cultivars","Drying Method":"Raised Bed Sun-Dried","Farm Gate":"Yes","Grade":"Grade 1","Lot size":"110","Packaging":"GrainPro Liner","Processing":"Dry Process (Natural)","Region":"Beshasha Badiya, Jimma","Roast Recommendations":"City to Full City","Type":"Farm Gate, Organic/Fair Trade Cert."}}

Indeed, many coops in the West of Ethiopia have struggled to find good buyers who will pay enough for the coffee, to manage their own debts, and from internal struggles and graft. Nano Challa was formed as part of an initiative to aid farmers in a more comprehensive way, starting cooperatives that could be governed by the farmers, rather than selling their coffee to privately run mills, and 'middle men'. The program was administered by a non-government organization that not only coordinates agronomists and managers for each of the coops they work with, but also has a business adviser assigned that helps the cooperative manage their debt, re-invest in quality improvements at the mill, and verifies distribution of income to all members. They've since graduated from this program, and are now part of an independent, local Union called Kata Muduga, who assist the cooperatives with functions like marketing, exporting, and general representation on an international scale. Nano Challa is a smaller cooperative coffee mill near Gera town in the Jimma region, Western Ethiopia. (The area also has some of the finest honey available in Ethiopia). This is from a collection site 2km from the original Nano Challa station called \"Genji Challa\". Being so close, they extend their farmer reach some, but also buy from many of the same coop members (deliveries can be made to either). The farms are at altitudes between 1900 to 2100 meters, planted in old regional varieties of coffee.","CuppingNotes":"The dry fragrance has potent honey floral note, with spiced tea, ginger snap cookie, and sweet citrus. The wet aroma comes off even stronger, with perfumed smells of white honey, and highlights of stone fruits, orange rind, and a mix of floral and herbal accents. The underlying sweetness in the brewed coffee has flavor aspects of white honey, and along with stone fruit accent notes, adds a floral aromatic impression in the nose. The compact sweetness opens up to fruited flavors, and acidity that is permeated by citrus-y, orange notes. There's a fresh nectarine flavor note that impacts aroma, and offers lingering fruited sweetness in the aftertaste. It's a delicious brew at City and City+ roast levels, and in my opinion, the juicy flavor profile offers a nice contrast to the crisp, floral coffees found in many of Ethiopia's southern regions. Nano Challa cools to a mix of flavor notes lie apricot and peach, lively orange juice, golden raisin, and with floral/herbal accents like tenadam and lemon grass. I pick up on a mouth pleasing tea-tannic bittering quality in the finish as well. Full City roasting cultivates a rich bittersweetness that is enmeshed with a lovely dark plum accent. Nano Challa has made for a knockout Ethiopian espresso in previous years, and I have no doubt in my mind that this year's lot lives up to those expectations.","Images":null,"AdditionalAttributes":{"Appearance":".2 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen","Arrival date":"June 2022 Arrival","Bag size":"60 KG","Certifications":"","Cultivar Detail":"Heirloom Cultivars","Drying Method":"Raised Bed Sun-Dried","Farm Gate":"Yes","Grade":"Grade 1","Lot size":"80","Packaging":"GrainPro Liner","Processing":"Wet Process (Washed)","Recommended for Espresso":"Yes","Region":"Gera, Jimma","Roast Recommendations":"City to Full City","Type":"Farm Gate, Organic/Fair Trade Cert."}}

This is one of the largest coffee producing areas in Gedeb, boasting semi-forested shade canopy in many parts, and altitudes ranging from 1900 to a staggering 2200 meters above sea level. The washing station Chelbesa is relatively new, having only been built back in 2019. It is part of a group of stations run by SNAP Specialty Coffee, Chelbesa being one of their most recent ventures. The wet mill is outfitted with ceramic fermentation tanks, which are supposed to retain heat  speeding up fermentation to some degree, and easier to clean than cement being a less porous material. They currently buy coffee from nearly 500 farmers in Chelbesa village. This fully washed, wet process coffee from Chelbesa exudes the clean floral characteristics we often think of as synonymous with the Yirga Cheffe region!

I was struck by some of the tropical fruit notes at City roast as well, hints of pineapple, and passion fruit. I picked up on a tropical papaya note in the wet aroma, with smells of dried stone fruit, honey, and elegant jasmine note that really draw you in. The cup at City roast level does not disappoint! Chelbesa Danche makes for an incredibly aromatic cup when roasted light, with depth of sweetness that act as a connecting point for some of the more elegant, outlier top notes. The coffee cools to flavors of orange spiced tea, and complex rue herbal accents play off the floral aromatics of jasmine, freesia, and fresh coriander. Our light roast boasted a modest level of acidity that brought to mind orange, and other sweet citrus, greatly influenced by the citrus flavor accents. Roasting super light can sometimes lead to stunted sweetness, but that wasn't the case with ours. Chelbesa's cup sweetness covers quite a bit of ground, and lasting in the finish too. It starts off transparent, like simple syrup, but then branches out to raw sugars, and fragrant honey  in the aftertaste.","Images":null,"AdditionalAttributes":{"Appearance":".2 d/300gr, 14-17 Screen - there are some small 14 screen beans in the mix, but far from the majority","Arrival date":"July 2022 Arrival","Bag size":"60 KG","Cultivar Detail":"Heirloom Cultivars","Drying Method":"Raised Bed Sun-Dried","Farm Gate":"Yes","Grade":"Grade 1","Lot size":"99","Packaging":"GrainPro Liner","Processing":"Wet Process (Washed)","Region":"Danche, Chelbesa Village, Gedeb Woreda","Roast Recommendations":"City to City+","Type":"Farm Gate"}}

The town of Kagumo is very near Gaaki, in Nyeri. Altitude in this region tops out at just over 1700 meters above sea level, and the landscape is graced with red volcanic loam soils, that's nutrient rich, and typical for this area. Farmers typically grow SL-28 and SL-34 Bourbon selections, with smaller amounts of Ruiru-11, and Batian varieties intermixed. There are currently around 1300 members of the Aguthi FCS who deliver their coffee cherry to this particular wet mill for processing.  We've bought one other coffee from Aguthi FCS, Gititu, and both coffees represent special attention to sorting all the way through processing. As with other good coops in Nyeri, they always have the farmer separate the ripeness of the coffee cherry before submitting it for processing, removing under-ripes that create astringency in the cup. Small things like this make a huge difference in the resulting cup flavors.","CuppingNotes":"The dry fragrance smells incredibly complex and sweet, with notes of vanilla, peaches and cream, and a sort of floral tea accent too.

Kagumo Peaberry produces incredible pour over brews at City roast level, with fruited sweetness that's attention grabbing, and bright spots of citrus and spice that all add up to a very special coffee. The cup sweetness is succulent and juicy, like a classic red fruit punch blend of berry, orange, and pineapple juices. I get notes of melon fruit salad, orange tea, and spiced cranberry juice. The acidity is pleasantly bright without being too grabby, and with an underlying juiciness in texture that's mouth pleasing. The coffee flavors shift and change as it cools, with remarkable aromatic depth. It's a coffee that just seems to reveal more and more as you move through it.

At 1870 meters above sea level, Kanyege rests in the hills just above the Kanzu site, and the coffee they are processing comes from farms as high as 2000 meters. Farmers in this region are growing older Bourbon cultivars, and while Kanyege produces mostly wet process, this 25 bag lot is a dry process lot. Dry processing (also referred to as \"naturals\") is when the whole coffee cherry is laid to dry with the seeds still inside. With all that fruit still intact, it can take 4 times as long to dry down, during which, fermentation does occur, having an affect of the coffee's cup characteristics. Dry process coffees tend to show more fruit forward flavors, bigger body, and milder acidity. The workers at the Kanyege site are floating coffee cherry before laying to dry, in order to identify and remove the underripe coffee that floats to the top (often called \"floaters\"). They are also sifting through the drying coffee cherry by hand in order to remove other physical defects. With the cherry still intact, it's difficult to spot all of the physical defects, and I found a few partial quakers and one full in the coffee I roasted. Full quakers are pretty easy to identify as their physical color remains light yellow no matter how dark the roast level.","CuppingNotes":"Looking back on my notes from last year, this dry process lot from Kanyege reads more berry forward, the aroma and cup flavors far from basic. City+ roasts see fruited hints accenting nice bittersweet cocoa smells in the dry fragrance, red berry, and even a slight floral note.

In the cup, fruit notes of juicy blackberry and fresh fig are tucked behind a substantial chocolate roast taste. The cup cools to a caramelized sugar sweetness, with a berry-type acidic impression that adds a moderate vibrance in the City/City+ roast range. This fruited brightness draws the fruit flavors out from the bittersweet background to some degree, offering a nice contrast to the truffle-like chocolate roast flavors. The aftertaste has hints of rustic dried fruits, as well as a mild tobacco note in the long finish.

The cooperative currently has just over 200 farmer members, and organizes the coffee deliveries, processing everything at their local wet mill, and then marketing to for export. One challenge the coop faces each year is patio space during the peak of the harvest, and this year, they plan to reinvest profits into building more beds. The farms at Sepukila are planted above 1350 meters, and the Kent variety is widespread, a cultivar with some resistance to leaf rust, and thought to be of Bourbon lineage. I was surprised to find that some of the farms are less than 1500 meters due to the fact that this coffee has well pronounced acidity when roasted light. Lower grown coffee can be softer, less dense, and that lack of density can mean lower potential for sweetness and acidity. That just isn't the case with this coffee! ","CuppingNotes":"The dry fragrance has a simple, but very nice sweetness of raw sugars, mild baking spices, and a sweetened dried fruit hint. The wet ground open up the profile to include more defined fruit and spice notes, like dried plum dusted in all-spice, still with a nice supporting sweetness underneath. The levels of acidity and sweetness are two of the first characteristics I noted when tasting this coffee, that on their own, construct a really nice, bright East African coffee. As the coffee cools off a little, those two dimensions open up to flavors of minimally processed sugars like turbinado and sucanat, dried date pieces, and a cinnamon stick aromatic accent. The acidity has a citric bite that hints at lemon juice, with some candied lemon peel too that adds to the aromatic profile. Darker fruit accents are trumped up with deeper roast development, though never quite overtake Sepukila's raw sugary sweetness.
