<blockquote>
<p>Nansebo has an herbal sweetness like rue, backed with a flavor of white honey
in City/City+ roasting that makes for a deliciously sweet Ethiopian cup. Clove
spice hints mark the dry fragrance, along with perfumed orange smells in our
light roasts. The wet aroma has a canned peach scent that culminates in a
likeness of peach pie with graham cracker crust. As a brewed coffee, Nansebo
pushes a deep level of honey sweetness at a wide range of roasts, City and
City+ roasts striking a nice level of balance between fruited sweetness and a
orange-like brightness. The cooling cup offers glimpses of stone fruit and
citrus notes too, tart apricot, nectarine, and a slightly underripe orange
flavor register. There&rsquo;s a contrasting, pleasant bittering sensation too that
reminds me of peach skins too, sweet-to-tart flavors rounding out the long
finish. Full City roast bear some darker fruited notes, plum and prune juice,
but in low volume comparatively to core bittersweetness of honey-backed cocoa
powder. Acidity is more muted at Full City too, and I found ours to make
incredible single origin espresso. Espresso shots have focuesed fruited notes,
blueberry and dark chocolate, tenedam spice, fresh coriander, and a nice
citrus zing.</p>

<h2 id="roast-notes">Roast Notes</h2>

<p>It was kinda cold outside while I roasted this (59°F;) I assume that&rsquo;s why this
took a minute longer roast than previously.</p>

<h2 id="cupping">Cupping</h2>

<p>Acidity: Light, refreshing acidity that reminds me of a good Salvadoran.</p>

<p>Sweetness: Buttery sweetness reminiscent of cookies.</p>

<p>Mouthfeel: Surprisingly oily.</p>

<p>Flavor: I think I taste some of the flavors in the SM tasting, like the canned
peaches or tart apricot.</p>

<p>Finish: The finish ramps down quickly and cleanly, leaving behind gentle notes
of the flavor without typical souring notes.</p>

<p>Balance: This is great.  Oddly it doesn&rsquo;t match any prior tasting notes.  Weird.</p>
