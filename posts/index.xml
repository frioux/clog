      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  La Tacita Floral proves that when it comes to espresso, a little Gesha cultivar goes a long way. To be fair, 1&amp;frasl;3 is no small amount, and from the high level of floral flavor and aroma found in the shot, I&amp;rsquo;d believe it if I were told this was 100% Gesha cultivar. We roasted several batches of this blend, and some of my favorites were on the lighter end of the roast spectrum, but with stretched roast times.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Light roasts of Yukiro have tart fruit and delicate floral notes, citrus-like acidic impressions as bright as any Ethiopia we&amp;rsquo;ve had so far this year. City roasts are where the most clarity in cup flavors are acheived, citric to tannic acidity propping up the complex nature of the coffee. The fragrance and aroma smell of honey and raw sugar, and a scent of black tea is accented by a hint of lemon.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  This Matalapa lot is an approachable cup, balanced core coffee flavors, and infinitely drinkable. The dry fragrance from the ground coffee has hazelnuts and honey granola scents, while the wet aromatics give a more volatile aromatic emphasis to the dry fragrance, praline, almonds and a hint of dried fruit. The cup flavors add to this a unique green tea accent at City+ roast, with the cup dominated by layered caramel and nutty roast tones, and a twist of orange rind in the finish.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s ([wbm])  The dry fragrance has a spiced grape smell, with a subtle citrus feature wrapped in maple sugar sweetness. Aromatically too, I picked up on a smell of citrus, more like dried/candied lemon peel, and with sweet layers of sugar browning smells. The cup of City roasts most echoes the notes on aroma, and you won&amp;rsquo;t be disappointed if light roasting is your preference. A soft lemonade note comes through along with a floral orange tea accent, and acidity has a slight grabbiness to it, akin to pink grapefruit.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s [wbm]  We bought two lots from Tome, one wet processed, and this dry processed. They&amp;rsquo;re both beautiful cups, and a side by side comparison shows just how much processing influences the cup. This DP is so fruit forward in comparison, strong dried and fresh fruit flavors, and sweetness with matched intensity. At City and City+ roast levels, the smells from the ground and wetted coffee are pretty incredible, peach, mango, molasses, raisiny dried fruit, and even subtle floral highllights.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s ([wbm])  This is a very unique flavor profile. From the dry grounds, berry and spice notes are clear, as well as malt sugars and honey. My lightest roasts have a graham cracker wet aroma, with a lemon bar like smell as well. City+ level has more honey sweetness, prominent berry tones, and sweet spice notes of ginger, and herbs. A floral jasmine tea note and spice accents come through clearly in the cup, and vibrant citrus weaves through it all.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s [wbm]  This Gesha lot makes for an interesting brew to say the least, tea notes proliferate in both aroma and cup flavors, from pearl jasmine to Assam teas. The cup is both floral and brisk, a flavor combo not necessarily unique to Gesha cultivar, but certainly unique to most Latin American coffees. An herbal sweetness marks the aroma, as do licorice tea, and a palm sugar scent as you near Full City.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s (wbm)  Delicious and delicate, this wet processed lot from Hambela Hassan is as sweet as it is floral, complex top notes burgeoning from the cups of light and middle roasts, and vibrant acidity helps construct a dynamic cup. The dry fragrance has perfumed florals, with a smell of peaches and cream, and a soft hint of vanilla. The wetted grounds of City roasts extend an aroma of peach, apricot, and nectarine, fruited smells with the volume of a natural process coffee, but more tea-like, and delicate in nature.</description>

      <guid>https://frioux.github.io/clog/posts/2018-08-18/</guid>
      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s (wbm)  Thageini has a big berry-like fragrance coming out of the grinder, red raspberry and aromatic sugar notes builiding out a sweet smelling profile. This perfumed mix continues into the wet aroma, smells of fruits cooked with molasses sugars coming off the steaming coffee crust, and a baking spice note accenting the steam. Berry and unrefined sugar notes are the first flavors that come to mind when sipping the hot cup, like red berry cooked down to a sugary pastry filling, along with an orange rind note that adds a tartness to the profile.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  The ground coffee has a clean scent of brown sugar and hazelnut, sort of a butter/shortbread cookie smell. The addition of hot water pulls out sugar browning sweetness, toffee nut smells, candied roasted almonds. Light roasts have soft lemon acidity that&amp;rsquo;s really a nice feature, a mellow tartness that emerges amidst unrefined sugar and raw nut flavors like Brazil nut and hazelnut. It adds a mouth cleansing affect in the finish too, which lends to the perception of a clean finish.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  The dry fragrance has a mix of sugar browning and spice smells in light to middle roasting, dried ginger and molasses, a subtle dried cherry accent. The wet aroma has a more intense sweetness that comes off like spiced molasses cookies, characteristics sensed in the dry fragrance gaining potency, and a whisp of florals comes through when breaking through the crust. The cup meets expectations set by the aromatic profile, base brown sugar and molasses flavors build as the cup cools, and baking spice hints offer pleasant contrast.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Peach and lime smells are released in the dry fragrance, a dried stone fruit sweetness and with zesty lime peel accents. Gidhey shows layered raw sugar sweetness in the ground coffee and wet aroma, warmed caramel-y smells released in the steam that have elements of caramelizing dark brown sugars, panela, sucanat, and more. City roasts are the most floral, a fresh aroma of gardenia flower coming through in the brewed coffee, along with a clean and sweet impression of simple syrup sweetener.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  This Dumerso dry-processed lot is a powerhouse in terms of fruit-forward aromatics. The dry-fragrance has a cornucopia of fruits, raspberry and ripe blueberry, Turkish apricots, grape juice, along with a substantial backdrop of bittersweet burnt sugars. The fruits approach floral dimensions, and a start jasmine note accents the ground coffee. The wet aromatics are equally intense, a representation of blackberry and strawberry toppings, a hint of dried mango, and a cacao-like bittersweetness in our roasts closer to Full City.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  La Tacita Floral proves that when it comes to espresso, a little Gesha cultivar goes a long way. To be fair, 1&amp;frasl;3 is no small amount, and from the high level of floral flavor and aroma found in the shot, I&amp;rsquo;d believe it if I were told this was 100% Gesha cultivar. We roasted several batches of this blend, and some of my favorites were on the lighter end of the roast spectrum, but with stretched roast times.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  The sweetness smelled in the dry fragrance has the pungency of black strap molasses with peppery tobacco accents. Both City+ and Full City roasts have potent, rustic sweetness, mixing syrupy fruit smells with earth-toned bittersweetness. The aroma is quite herbal, and a complex mix of bittersweet cocoa and green herbals are released on the break. The cup is complex, malt syrups with bell pepper and burdock root accents as it cools.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Nano Challa has a honey sweet smell in lightest roasts (City), stone fruit and tea suggestions, and sugary sweetness that finds it&amp;rsquo;s apex when adding hot water. Brown sugar and toffee smells are focused in the wet aroma, a candy sweetness that reminds me of torrone (minus the nuts), and the break releases a light accent of pearl jasmine tea, giving way to more weighty fruited smells that have elements of fruit cobbler.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  We&amp;rsquo;re really pleased with this year&amp;rsquo;s lot of Baaroo. A balanced coffee, Baaroo&amp;rsquo;s profile has just the right levels of complex sugar browning sweetness and subtle top notes to reflect coffees from the origin. The dry fragrance has a smell of dark toffee, so sweet and candy-like, with an understated peach note of the canned, syrupy sweet variety. Adding hot water sees a boost in stone fruit aromatics, like apricot and brown sugar,, as well as a peak in sugary sweetness, a maple icing scent filling the steam.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Cupping a City+ roast of Santa Lucia, the ground coffee brings a subtle sweetness to the table, bittering core coffee characteristics present with a layer of unrefined sugar sweetness mixed in. The coffee makes quite a transformation from this humble start, wet aromatics giving promise of a bigger coffee than the fragrance lets on to. A coconut and dark chocolate smell comes up in the steam, along with fruited accents that are still a little on the dull side, but their presence is definite.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  The dry fragrance of San Pedro Necta has nice sweet smelling dry fragrance, allusions to ginger snap cookies at City roast level with a mix of dark sugar and subtle spice notes, and Full City roasts shift to strong bittersweetness that is accompanied by wafts of raisin and cola. There&amp;rsquo;s a nice range of smells here, and adding hot water ushers in more roasted nut type smells in the light roast, whereas bittersweetness remains resolute at Full City, and breaking through the crust gives off an incredible smell of dark chocolate with dried fruit accents.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  This Dumerso dry-processed lot is a powerhouse in terms of fruit-forward aromatics. The dry-fragrance has a cornucopia of fruits, raspberry and ripe blueberry, Turkish apricots, grape juice, along with a substantial backdrop of bittersweet burnt sugars. The fruits approach floral dimensions, and a start jasmine note accents the ground coffee. The wet aromatics are equally intense, a representation of blackberry and strawberry toppings, a hint of dried mango, and a cacao-like bittersweetness in our roasts closer to Full City.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  The dry fragrance of San Pedro Necta has nice sweet smelling dry fragrance, allusions to ginger snap cookies at City roast level with a mix of dark sugar and subtle spice notes, and Full City roasts shift to strong bittersweetness that is accompanied by wafts of raisin and cola. There&amp;rsquo;s a nice range of smells here, and adding hot water ushers in more roasted nut type smells in the light roast, whereas bittersweetness remains resolute at Full City, and breaking through the crust gives off an incredible smell of dark chocolate with dried fruit accents.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Cupping a City+ roast of Santa Lucia, the ground coffee brings a subtle sweetness to the table, bittering core coffee characteristics present with a layer of unrefined sugar sweetness mixed in. The coffee makes quite a transformation from this humble start, wet aromatics giving promise of a bigger coffee than the fragrance lets on to. A coconut and dark chocolate smell comes up in the steam, along with fruited accents that are still a little on the dull side, but their presence is definite.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  We&amp;rsquo;re really pleased with this year&amp;rsquo;s lot of Baaroo. A balanced coffee, Baaroo&amp;rsquo;s profile has just the right levels of complex sugar browning sweetness and subtle top notes to reflect coffees from the origin. The dry fragrance has a smell of dark toffee, so sweet and candy-like, with an understated peach note of the canned, syrupy sweet variety. Adding hot water sees a boost in stone fruit aromatics, like apricot and brown sugar,, as well as a peak in sugary sweetness, a maple icing scent filling the steam.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Nano Challa has a honey sweet smell in lightest roasts (City), stone fruit and tea suggestions, and sugary sweetness that finds it&amp;rsquo;s apex when adding hot water. Brown sugar and toffee smells are focused in the wet aroma, a candy sweetness that reminds me of torrone (minus the nuts), and the break releases a light accent of pearl jasmine tea, giving way to more weighty fruited smells that have elements of fruit cobbler.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Nansebo has an herbal sweetness like rue, backed with a flavor of white honey in City/City+ roasting that makes for a deliciously sweet Ethiopian cup. Clove spice hints mark the dry fragrance, along with perfumed orange smells in our light roasts. The wet aroma has a canned peach scent that culminates in a likeness of peach pie with graham cracker crust. As a brewed coffee, Nansebo pushes a deep level of honey sweetness at a wide range of roasts, City and City+ roasts striking a nice level of balance between fruited sweetness and a orange-like brightness.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s (From Google Cache:)
 The dry fragrance of Juanambú has a butter toffee nut smell to it, City and City+ roasts offer caramel/toffee overtones, with roasted almond and black walnut smells underneath. The level of sweetness is prominent in the wet aroma, a scent of fresh baked cinnamon rolls with white icing, and a strong note of caramelizing sugars. The cup has raw sugar sweetness that comes off in layers; dark brown sugar, vanilla caramels, malt syrup, and honeyed hints.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  This Pacamara lot from Alpina has such an interesting herbal sweetness in the cup. City and City+ roasts have flavors of sweet basil and celery soda, and an delightful green floral accent note. The fragrance and aroma smell complex, floral tea and sweet herbaceous notes permeate from the coffee, and the impressions I get are reminiscent of Maracaturra coffees, the large bean hybrid of Maragoype and Caturra that is popular in Nicaragua.</description>

Flavor: I taste the peanut cookie somewhat and definitely the cocoa powder.
Finish: This coffee has a finish I wish I had a name for; it reminds me of cheap coffee grounds.
Balance: I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t buy this coffee again and I think that savory is likely something to warn me off of a coffee in general.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  The dry fragrance touches on brown sugar and vanilla bean smells, along with a nice dried apple note. There&amp;rsquo;s a clean sweetness in the coffee smells, and the wet aromatics show characteristics of raw brown sugar, and definitely some fruit, but hard to put my finger on exactly what. A honey to brown sugar sweetness is striking in the brewed coffee, and lays a stabilizing groundwork on which the rest of the profile rests.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  City+ to Vienna: Big body, low acidity, sweet to savory notes, brown sugar, almond paste, walnut, peanut cookie, cocoa powder.
 Acidity: I don&amp;rsquo;t get an acidity out of this.
Sweetness: Just a touch of sweetness.
Mouthfeel: Slightly astringent.
Flavor: I can taste the savory notes here. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan but it is definitely distinctive.
Finish: Finish seems stronger or more flavorful than the initial taste, which is unusual and something that I typically dislike.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  The smells in the dry grounds of Riakiberu are attractive, City+ roasts offering a mix of malty sweetness, and berry jelly. Fruits are present without overpowering the aroma, and while smells of baked goods, caramelizing sugars, and such billow in the steam from the hot coffee, subtler accent notes like berry and melon compliment this sugary base. Riakiberu brews really well, City+ roasts promising flavors of sagarcane juice, cantelope, and an interesting herbal note of celery soda.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Santa Julia is sure to garner universal acclaim, a real crowd pleaser. Raw sugar, roasted nut, and cinnamon allude to granola, with hints of hazelnut, and dried apple.
 Acidity: Bright, refreshing, and complex.
Sweetness: Just a touch of sweetness.
Mouthfeel: Minimal
Flavor: I can taste the nuts and dried apple.
Finish: Refreshing finish; neither sour nor bitter.
Balance: Great coffee. I will buy from this estate again.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  City+ to Vienna: Big body, low acidity, sweet to savory notes, brown sugar, almond paste, walnut, peanut cookie, cocoa powder.
 Acidity: Much brighter than the coffee I was drinking last week, which was brewed AeroPress. I&amp;rsquo;m surprised because this is cold brew.
Sweetness: Very, very faint sweetness that I sometimes suspect is a mirage caused by the low temperature of the coffee.
Mouthfeel: Slightly tannic. Not as oily as I&amp;rsquo;d hope for.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  City+ to Vienna: Big body, low acidity, sweet to savory notes, brown sugar, almond paste, walnut, peanut cookie, cocoa powder.
 Acidity: Little to none.
Sweetness: Little to none
Mouthfeel: Very thin.
Flavor: I do think I taste some of the nutty flavors alluded to in the SM review.
Finish: Having trouble grokking the finish right now.
Overall I think this isn&amp;rsquo;t great. Maybe it will grow on me through the week but it&amp;rsquo;s not what I&amp;rsquo;m usually looking for.</description>

      <description>I definitely taste the roasted nut and maybe the apple now too. Not sure about the sugar, but there is a refreshing acidity which I associate with good cold brew.</description>

      <description>Blend  1lb Ethiopia Dry Process Yirga Cheffe Wenago 1&amp;frasl;4 lb Sumatra Aceh-Mandheling  Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s  Wenago is a nice late season Ethiopia, and anything but subtle: strawberry, raspberry, red apple, stone fruit, fading to sweet tobacco and aromatic wood notes in the long finish. (and above)
 Very little stone flavors. Fairly bland. Maybe this isn&amp;rsquo;t good for cold brew? ☹</description>

      <description>Roasted differently than normal; dropped heat gun to low during first crack. I think that this underroasted the beans just a little. Coffee is still good but in addition to last week&amp;rsquo;s notes it tastes a little green.</description>

      <description>Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s:  Brooding dark cacao notes, pulpy fruit, dried banana, lingonberry, mossy, forest floor-type earthiness, herbacious
 Very rich and strong; Agree re mossy, forest floor, and herbacious. Prefer FC+ to French.
This may grow on me, but as it stands this coffee is really not my style</description>
