<blockquote>
<p>This Pacamara lot from Alpina has such an interesting herbal sweetness in the
cup. City and City+ roasts have flavors of sweet basil and celery soda, and an
delightful green floral accent note. The fragrance and aroma smell complex,
floral tea and sweet herbaceous notes permeate from the coffee, and the
impressions I get are reminiscent of Maracaturra coffees, the large bean
hybrid of Maragoype and Caturra that is popular in Nicaragua. This coffee
excels as a pour over brew, with well articulated flavor notes discernible in
the cup. Acidity is brilliant in light roasts, like tangy citrus, a vibrance
that holds up as the coffee cools. The level of sweetness is moderate, and
transparent like simple syrup sugar, lending sweetness without the added
molasses flavors that come with sugar in the raw.</p>

<p>Another windy day.  I preheated the bucket for four minutes (measured) and tried
to use the lid of the bread maker to keep the hot air in, but it nonetheless
took two extra minutes to get to first crack.  I also tried the ice-pack cooling
method again.  Seemed to work but I should use a thermometer to see for sure.</p>

<h2 id="cupping">Cupping</h2>

<p>Acidity: floral acidity, almost like the acidity of a mango without the flavor
of it.</p>

<p>Sweetness: I don&rsquo;t taste any sweetness.</p>

<p>Mouthfeel: Very oily.</p>

<p>Flavor: Somewhat savory, robust floral flavor.</p>

<p>Finish: Almost rusty finish.</p>

<p>Balance: This coffee is good but doesn&rsquo;t taste like previous renditions of this
coffee.  I can&rsquo;t tell if it was because of the different brew method (AeroPress
vs cold brew) or the different environment (quiet apartment vs screaming kids on
vacation) was the cause.</p>
