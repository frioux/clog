<blockquote>
<p>Light roasts of Yukiro have tart fruit and delicate floral notes, citrus-like
acidic impressions as bright as any Ethiopia we&rsquo;ve had so far this year. City
roasts are where the most clarity in cup flavors are acheived, citric to
tannic acidity propping up the complex nature of the coffee. The fragrance and
aroma smell of honey and raw sugar, and a scent of black tea is accented by a
hint of lemon. The aroma is as sweet as the smell of fresh baked ginger snaps,
sugar browning and subtle spice intimations highlighting the steam. A pour
over of City roasts yield perfumed retronasal aromatics, especially once
cooled. A lilac floral note graces the cup, along with citrus accent notes
such as sweet lime, orange, and pink grapefruit. The coffee flavors are clean
and clear, uncompromised by much in the way of typical bittering coffee tones.
The sweetness is like simple syrup, or table sugar, sweetening the cup without
drawing your attention away from this coffee&rsquo;s inherent vibrance. Our City+
roast delivered a mild dried peach note, caramel sweetness, and orange rind in
the aftertaste. Yukiro shows best when roasted light and bright, and makes a
fantastic pour over brew option.</p>
