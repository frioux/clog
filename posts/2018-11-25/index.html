<blockquote>
<p>Peach and lime smells are released in the dry fragrance, a dried stone fruit
sweetness and with zesty lime peel accents. Gidhey shows layered raw sugar
sweetness in the ground coffee and wet aroma, warmed caramel-y smells
released in the steam that have elements of caramelizing dark brown sugars,
panela, sucanat, and more. City roasts are the most floral, a fresh aroma of
gardenia flower coming through in the brewed coffee, along with a clean and
sweet impression of simple syrup sweetener. A lemon note lightly graces the
cup of light roasts too, providing a solidness in structure to an otherwise
rather delicate cup (these light roasts remind me of a delicate Yirga
Cheffe). The cooling cup reveals more fruited accents, pomelo tartness, peach
tea, along with a sweet flame grape note. The finish is pointed if not short,
and muted flavors of vanilla and powdered sugar come through in the finish,
and reminds me of biscochitios (often referred to as Mexican wedding
cookies). The perfumed qualities of Gidhey show best with light roasting, and
I recommend a rather tight roast range of City to City+.</p>
