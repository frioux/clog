<blockquote>
<p>This Pacamara lot from Alpina has such an interesting herbal sweetness in the
cup. City and City+ roasts have flavors of sweet basil and celery soda, and an
delightful green floral accent note. The fragrance and aroma smell complex,
floral tea and sweet herbaceous notes permeate from the coffee, and the
impressions I get are reminiscent of Maracaturra coffees, the large bean
hybrid of Maragoype and Caturra that is popular in Nicaragua. This coffee
excels as a pour over brew, with well articulated flavor notes discernible in
the cup. Acidity is brilliant in light roasts, like tangy citrus, a vibrance
that holds up as the coffee cools. The level of sweetness is moderate, and
transparent like simple syrup sugar, lending sweetness without the added
molasses flavors that come with sugar in the raw.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Acidity: Bright acidity reminiscent of some kind of citrus thing, or maybe
celery, as SM said.</p>

<p>Sweetness: The sweetness is subtle and pleasant.  I can taste it mostly on the
edges.</p>

<p>Mouthfeel: Oilier than I expected, given how light this roast turned out.</p>

<p>Flavor: Very rich; almost tastes coppery, but certainly not over-acidic.</p>

<p>Finish: A long, slow finish that echos the flavor.</p>

<p>Balance: This coffee is really good.  I associate it with the <a href="/posts/2017-10-21/">last Salvadoran I
had</a> in that it has a very clean flavor, but it&rsquo;s not at all bland.</p>
