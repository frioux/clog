<blockquote>
<p>Nansebo has an herbal sweetness like rue, backed with a flavor of white honey
in City/City+ roasting that makes for a deliciously sweet Ethiopian cup. Clove
spice hints mark the dry fragrance, along with perfumed orange smells in our
light roasts. The wet aroma has a canned peach scent that culminates in a
likeness of peach pie with graham cracker crust. As a brewed coffee, Nansebo
pushes a deep level of honey sweetness at a wide range of roasts, City and
City+ roasts striking a nice level of balance between fruited sweetness and a
orange-like brightness. The cooling cup offers glimpses of stone fruit and
citrus notes too, tart apricot, nectarine, and a slightly underripe orange
flavor register. There&rsquo;s a contrasting, pleasant bittering sensation too that
reminds me of peach skins too, sweet-to-tart flavors rounding out the long
finish. Full City roast bear some darker fruited notes, plum and prune juice,
but in low volume comparatively to core bittersweetness of honey-backed cocoa
powder. Acidity is more muted at Full City too, and I found ours to make
incredible single origin espresso. Espresso shots have focuesed fruited notes,
blueberry and dark chocolate, tenedam spice, fresh coriander, and a nice
citrus zing.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Acidity: Definitely a citrusy kick.</p>

<p>Sweetness: The sweetness in this coffee is good, not overbearing, but strange.
It&rsquo;s hard to place where it is.</p>

<p>Mouthfeel: Somewhat astringent.  I don&rsquo;t think this was underroasted but it may
have been underdeveloped, given the weight loss.</p>

<p>Flavor: This is much richer than <a href="/posts/2017-11-15/">the last Ethiopian I had</a>;
not to say I prefer the last one but it was more approachable.  I would mostly
compare it to plums and plum juice.</p>

<p>Finish: A lot of the flavor lingers in the finish, instead of what usually is at
best a ghost of the flavor.</p>

<p>Balance: This is a good coffee but I need to spend more time with it to really
get it.  The rich plum notes are great but so unusual I am still trying to
figure it out.</p>
