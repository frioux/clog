<blockquote>
<p>This is a very unique flavor profile. From the dry grounds, berry and spice
notes are clear, as well as malt sugars and honey. My lightest roasts have a
graham cracker wet aroma, with a lemon bar like  smell as well. City+ level
has more honey sweetness, prominent berry tones, and sweet spice notes of
ginger, and herbs. A floral jasmine tea note and spice accents come through
clearly in the cup, and vibrant citrus weaves through it all. Lemony acidity,
and citrus flavor notes provide a high toned piquant character for this
coffee, particularly in the lighter roast levels. As the cup cools, sweet
spice and lemon come up, coalescing as ginger-spiced lemonade, and the
crowning floral note lingers in the aftertaste. My City+ roast had more of a
berry-focused cup profile, with tart blueberry skin, and grape flavors, subtle
wine-like fruit accents, and citrus acidic impression still shining bright.
The body is fairly light and increases as the cup cools, with a waxy mouthfeel
and a suggestion of walnut oil. This isn&rsquo;t an agressive coffee, but rather a
very aromatic, delicate, and distinct cup.</p>
