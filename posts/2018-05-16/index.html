<blockquote>
<p>Cupping a City+ roast of Santa Lucia, the ground coffee brings a subtle
sweetness to the table, bittering core coffee characteristics present with a
layer of unrefined sugar sweetness mixed in. The coffee makes quite a
transformation from this humble start, wet aromatics giving promise of a
bigger coffee than the fragrance lets on to. A coconut and dark chocolate
smell comes up in the steam, along with fruited accents that are still a
little on the dull side, but their presence is definite. And the brewed coffee
gives the final show, a sweet undercurrent of toffee and honey flavors,
offsetting central bittersweetness. There&rsquo;s life breathed into the fruited
tones sensed early on in aroma, and they take form as accents of dried peach,
whole dried banana, and coconut chips. Santa Lucia has lovely apple/malic
acidic impression at this roast level too, which adds definition to the
flavors in the cup profile. Body is noticeably juicy too, and I think taking a
shade darker (Full City) will yield dense bittersweetness and viscous
mouthfeel, not to mention make a good option for Costa Rican single origin
espresso.</p>

<h2 id="cupping">Cupping</h2>

<p>Acidity: Light, straightforward acidity.</p>

<p>Sweetness:  Very minor sweetness that I would associate with coconut.</p>

<p>Mouthfeel: Clean, light feel.</p>

<p>Flavor: I taste a bit of the apple, coconut, and dark chocolate.</p>

<p>Finish:  Heavy on the dark chocolate.</p>

<p>Balance: This is one of my favorite coffees, still.  I love the clean, clear,
straightforward flavor.</p>
