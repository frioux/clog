<blockquote>
<p>Nano Challa has a honey sweet smell in lightest roasts (City), stone fruit and
tea suggestions, and sugary sweetness that finds it&rsquo;s apex when adding hot
water. Brown sugar and toffee smells are focused in the wet aroma, a candy
sweetness that reminds me of torrone (minus the nuts), and the break releases
a light accent of pearl jasmine tea, giving way to more weighty fruited smells
that have elements of fruit cobbler. Brewed, Nano Challa produces a lightly
fruited cup at City and City+ roast levels, with refined sweetness, and
pristine finish. The underlying flavor is reminiscent of white honey, which is
mildly fruited in flavor, and an aromatic note of ginger chew candies. Lighter
roasts have a mild citrus note like orange juice, pulp and all, along with
subtle Earl Grey and Jasmine accents. Darker fruit tones are built up at
deeper roast levels, along with a Ricola-like dark herbal aspect, and the
finish is marked by pleasant bittering qualities  of cacao and dried orange
peel. A mild citrus-like acdity serves as a focal point too, especially in the
lighter roasts, adding a mouthcleansing affect to the finish. This years&rsquo; Nano
Challa has a dense mouthfeel, especially in middle to dark roasting, making
for a nice choice for espresso blend accent coffee.</p>

<h2 id="cupping">Cupping</h2>

<p>Acidity: Very astringent acidity.  Gut feeling is underroasted.</p>

<p>Sweetness: I get a touch of the sweetness but can barely taste it past the
acidity.</p>

<p>Mouthfeel: Dry, like the stuff between walnuts.</p>

<p>Flavor: To me this just tastes grassy.</p>

<p>Finish: I get some interesting flavors <em>long</em> after the finish.</p>

<p>Balance: Not great.  Next time I roast this I&rsquo;ll go for a darker roast.  Maybe
I&rsquo;ll revisit this cupping on Monday and see if I have acclimated to the coffee
more. freesdsfds</p>
