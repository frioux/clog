<p>By standard cupping methods for brewed coffees, the profile is much &ldquo;bigger&rdquo;
than previous years, and extracting this blend in an espresso machine produces
something very intense, sweet, and complex. The dry fragrance of City roasts
have citrus and tropical fruit suggestions, which are still prevalent in
darker roasts but with an overlay of chocolate notes. The wet aroma is
downright mouthwatering. Fruited notes are like peaches and apricots baked
with brown sugar, spiced cake, and floral hints - our FC smelled like
jasmine-infused dark chocolate bar. As a brewed coffee, this is a really
amazing blend. So versatile, showing great from City to Full City, lightest
roasts being very fruit-forward and clean - nectarine, mango, fragrant berry.
It shows surprising level of body at these light roast levels too, carrying
with it a syrupy-thick sweetness. Full City roasts develop rich chocolate
flavors, with a nice slab of blackberry syrup. Ethiopiques makes for an
intense ride through the espresso machine. The chocolate roast taste is
pungent, aggressive, bittersweet, and long-lasting on the palate. But it is
also very clean, succinct, not earthy or rustic. On top of this are intense
florals - jasmine and sweet pea - lemon oil and rind, raisiny ripe fruit and
red berries. The body seems bolstered by the intense cup flavors, and has the
effect of satiny chocolate. It&rsquo;s fantastic! My preference is about 2 oz in 24
seconds, brew head temp right around 205 degrees. We are finding this also
makes amazing Americano (espresso + water), which is no surprise. This can
also be used as the &ldquo;bright&rdquo; component in a blend that tones it down a bit.
For example <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> Brazil or El Salvador with <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> Ethiopiques.</p>
