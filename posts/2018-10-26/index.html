<blockquote>
<p>We bought two lots from Tome, one wet processed, and this dry processed.
They&rsquo;re both beautiful cups, and a side by side comparison shows just how much
processing influences the cup. This DP is so fruit forward in comparison,
strong dried and fresh fruit flavors, and sweetness with matched intensity. At
City and City+ roast levels, the smells from the ground and wetted coffee are
pretty incredible, peach, mango, molasses, raisiny dried fruit, and even
subtle floral highllights. Closer to Full City brings about equalizing
bittersweetness, but not without a high level of cooked fruit smells too. A
brewed City roast highlights floral notes in Tome, a flavor of floral berry,
blueberry, blackberry coming to mind. Fruit flavor notes are juicy, and
candied in the lighter roasts, reminding me of aspects of stone fruit and
papaya nectars, and berry flavored bubble gum. These heavier handed flavor
tones are contrasted by delicate accent notes of hibiscus tea and rose petal
florals when the coffee cools, that all together construct a complex flavor
portrait. A cooled cup expresses some citrus and bittersweet cocoa notes as
well, which a friend I was tasting with described as chocolate-covered,
dehydrated orange slices. If you&rsquo;re a fan of fruit-forward naturals, you&rsquo;ll be
amazed at all that Tome has to offer. Best to steer clear of 2nd snaps in
order to enjoy what&rsquo;s special about this coffee.</p>

<h2 id="roast-notes">Roast Notes</h2>

<p>It was really cold outside, hence the sluggish roast.  Also, this coffee seemed
to roast somewhat unevenly.  I didn&rsquo;t note if that happened last time but I
vaguely remember it being that way.</p>

<h2 id="cupping">Cupping</h2>

<p>Acidity: Immediate bite at the first taste.  Reminds me of rhubarb.</p>

<p>Sweetness: Minimal.</p>

<p>Flavor: Tropical fruit flavors.</p>

<p>Finish: I get a rich, pleasant flavor on the finish that reminds me of the
orange, cocoa, and juice.</p>

<p>Balance: This coffee is great;  I think I might have underroasted it a touch
this time due to the whether but it still shines through.</p>
