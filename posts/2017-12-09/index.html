<p>The dry fragrance of Juanambú has a butter toffee nut smell to it, City and
City+ roasts offer caramel/toffee overtones, with roasted almond and black
walnut smells underneath. The level of sweetness is prominent in the wet
aroma, a scent of fresh baked cinnamon rolls with white icing, and a strong
note of caramelizing sugars. The cup has raw sugar sweetness that comes off in
layers; dark brown sugar, vanilla caramels, malt syrup, and honeyed hints. At
City there is a lemon vibrance that intensifies as the cup cools, tart, and
tea-like, and subtle fruited notes of golden raisin and date pieces pop up.
The finish is sweet in the short run, shifting to a long bittersweet end. This
bittersweetness is more dominant in Full City roasts, but the sweet side of
this equation is really hard to beat, let alone eclipse. I loved the
brightness and fruit notes captured in our light roasts, but this is also a
great option for those looking for coffees suited for 2nd snaps. Juanambú is
made up of really dense beans (as a result of cultivar and altitude) that can
handle high heat without issue.</p>

<h2 id="roast-notes">Roast Notes</h2>

<p>Four minutes of preheating the bucket again.  Significant weight loss and much
faster than <a href="/posts/2017-11-23/">last time</a>.</p>

<h2 id="cupping">Cupping</h2>

<p>Acidity: Acidic bite right at the beginning.  Hard to pull it apart from
&ldquo;Colombian&rdquo;-flavored.</p>

<p>Sweetness: I am not at this time detecting any sweetness.</p>

<p>Mouthfeel: Surprisingly oily.</p>

<p>Flavor: This has a weird coppery flavor.  Like stewed fruit with blood or
something.</p>

<p>Finish: Incredibly light finish given how powerful the main flavor is.</p>

<p>Balance: I would call this a success.  It&rsquo;s still the weakest coffee of the lot,
but after changing up the roast a bit I do think I enjoy this rendition.</p>
