<blockquote>
<p>This Pacamara lot from Alpina has such an interesting herbal sweetness in the
cup. City and City+ roasts have flavors of sweet basil and celery soda, and an
delightful green floral accent note. The fragrance and aroma smell complex,
floral tea and sweet herbaceous notes permeate from the coffee, and the
impressions I get are reminiscent of Maracaturra coffees, the large bean
hybrid of Maragoype and Caturra that is popular in Nicaragua. This coffee
excels as a pour over brew, with well articulated flavor notes discernible in
the cup. Acidity is brilliant in light roasts, like tangy citrus, a vibrance
that holds up as the coffee cools. The level of sweetness is moderate, and
transparent like simple syrup sugar, lending sweetness without the added
molasses flavors that come with sugar in the raw.</p>

<h2 id="roast-notes">Roast Notes</h2>

<p>Nothing especially unusual.  Beautiful day. Cooled with bowls then cookie sheet.
Preheated bowl.</p>

<h2 id="cupping">Cupping</h2>

<p>Acidity: Atypical (of my roasts) bite at the front; maybe the citrus notes in
the SM tasting notes.</p>

<p>Sweetness: Very subtle sweetness, almost completely overwhelmed by flavor and
acidity.</p>

<p>Mouthfeel: Astringent.</p>

<p>Flavor: Having trouble putting my finger on it.  Maybe the celery mentioned
above?  Could be some other green plant?</p>

<p>Finish: Definitely tasting the celery soda on the finish.</p>

<p>Balance: Solid coffee, but not my favorite roast of this coffee.</p>
