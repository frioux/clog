<p>The dry fragrance has a spiced grape smell, with a subtle citrus feature
wrapped in maple sugar sweetness. Aromatically too, I picked up on a smell of
citrus, more like dried/candied lemon peel, and with sweet layers of sugar
browning smells. The cup of City roasts most echoes the notes on aroma, and
you won&rsquo;t be disappointed if light roasting is your preference. A soft
lemonade note comes through along with a floral orange tea accent, and acidity
has a slight grabbiness to it, akin to pink grapefruit. Berry notes accent the
cup as well, but don&rsquo;t really come through in City roasts, at least in
comparison to a City+ or even Full City roast. It&rsquo;s kind of surprising how
just a shade darker reveals a whole other coffee. Fruit and sugar tones come
off like blackberry pancake syrup, and jammy fruit filling sandwiched between
layers of dark chocolate. No matter where you wind up on the City to Full City
spectrum, a lasting sweetness prevails. Complexity will shine in pour over
brewing, and even full submersion brews such as French Press.</p>
