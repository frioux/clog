 Acidity: Much brighter than the coffee I was drinking last week, which was brewed AeroPress. I&rsquo;m surprised because this is cold brew.
Sweetness: Very, very faint sweetness that I sometimes suspect is a mirage caused by the low temperature of the coffee.

<blockquote>
<p>City+ to Vienna: Big body, low acidity, sweet to savory notes, brown sugar,
almond paste, walnut, peanut cookie, cocoa powder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Acidity: Much brighter than the coffee I was drinking last week, which was
brewed AeroPress.  I&rsquo;m surprised because this is cold brew.</p>

<p>Sweetness: Very, very faint sweetness that I sometimes suspect is a mirage
caused by the low temperature of the coffee.</p>

<p>Mouthfeel: Slightly tannic.  Not as oily as I&rsquo;d hope for.</p>

<p>Flavor: Spartan.  Not a ton of flavor here but what is there is good.</p>

<p>Finish: Likely related to the minimal flavor, I think the best term for this
finish is clean.&rdquo;  There could be more, but at least what is there is not bad.</p>

<p>Balance: &ldquo;Not bad.&rdquo;</p>
