<blockquote>
<p>Delicious and delicate, this wet processed lot from Hambela Hassan is as sweet
as it is floral, complex top notes burgeoning from the cups of light and
middle roasts, and vibrant acidity helps construct a dynamic cup. The dry
fragrance has perfumed florals, with a smell of peaches and cream, and a soft
hint of vanilla. The wetted grounds of City roasts extend an aroma of peach,
apricot, and nectarine, fruited smells with the volume of a natural process
coffee, but more tea-like, and delicate in nature. City roasting is where it&rsquo;s
at for me, a lovely cup profile built from notes of stone fruit and citrus,
and easily discernible jasmine floral accents. The hot cup has apricot and
Assam tea flavors, crystal clear sweetness, and with a very low bittering
coffee tone underneath. As the coffee cools down some, a tangerine note
presents a tart/sweet aspect that adds structure to the cup, and a layer of
raw cane juice is experienced from start to finish. Citrus acidity seems to
grow as you move through the coffee, and fruited flavors shift from
apricot/nectarine, to tangy orange, pink grapefruit, and more. Hambela Hassan
has a clean finish, and a flavor of English Breakfast tea highlights the long
aftertaste. I did try a Full City roast too, but found that smokey roast tones
detracted from the complexity found a couple shades lighter.</p>

<p>It was raining and cold but I didn&rsquo;t think to cover the machine till near the
end, so I suspect I lost a lot of heat that way.</p>
