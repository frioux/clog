<blockquote>
<p>The dry fragrance has a cooked brown sugar smell, rounded and sweet, and with
whiffs of slab apricot and other dried fruits. The aroma has a clean raw sugar
sweet smell and breaking through the crust releases more delicate floral and
fruit notes. What a great cup; clean fruited flavors, zesty but not too
bright, refreshing and mouth cleansing. At City roast level the coffee&rsquo;s
sweetness is much more refined than the fragrance would leave you to believe,
like simple syrup and white table sugar, and a tart lemon note is a cup
highlight. Floral notes bring an elegant touch to the cup profile, perfumed
lilac and jasmine notes adding a complex overlay. The cooling coffee sees
fresh fruited notes hinting at flame grape and Meyer lemon at City roast, and
a plump blueberry note in more developed roasts as well. I recommend sticking
to the lighter end of the roast spectrum, partly because of Hana Asrat
Tilhun&rsquo;s light body which doesn&rsquo;t bode well for propping up smokey roast tones
in my opinion.</p>
