<blockquote>
<p>The dry fragrance of San Pedro Necta has nice sweet smelling dry fragrance,
allusions to ginger snap cookies at City roast level with a mix of dark sugar
and subtle spice notes, and Full City roasts shift to strong bittersweetness
that is accompanied by wafts of raisin and cola. There&rsquo;s a nice range of
smells here, and adding hot water ushers in more roasted nut type smells in
the light roast, whereas bittersweetness remains resolute at Full City, and
breaking through the crust gives off an incredible smell of dark chocolate
with dried fruit accents. As a cup, my City+ roast San Pedro Necta showcased
flavors of toasted muscovado sugar and roasted almond, vanilla and cinnamon
powder accents in the finish. Acidity is on the &lsquo;slight&rsquo; side, but still
offers a soft structure ala Red Delicious apples. There&rsquo;s a chocolate
undertone too that flourishes when you reach Full City roast level. A nice,
rich flavor of fine Dutch drinking cocoa comes through in darker roasts and
hangs on long after the final sip. This is a great drinking coffee, and one
that fits the daily drinker roster - sweet, balanced, bodied, and without any
&lsquo;over the top&rsquo;, top notes. San Pedro Necta also makes a great dual-use coffee
with SO espresso shots displaying rich chocolate tones and inky mouthfeel in
the Full City roast range.</p>

<h2 id="cupping">Cupping</h2>

<p>Acidity: Very subdued, muted acidity.</p>

<p>Sweetness: Hard to taste the sweetness without getting the rich finish and
flavor.</p>

<p>Mouthfeel: Rich</p>

<p>Flavor: I taste the raisins and other dried fruit flavors.  Also taste the
bitter cocoa</p>

<p>Finish: Hard to tell if I like it or hate it.  Very rich and flavorful but just
on the edge of what I might consider a rusty, overroasted flavor.</p>

<p>Balance: I think I&rsquo;ll like this coffee but it&rsquo;s hard to say.  Gotta give it some
time.</p>
