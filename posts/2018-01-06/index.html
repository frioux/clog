<blockquote>
<p>Nansebo has an herbal sweetness like rue, backed with a flavor of white honey
in City/City+ roasting that makes for a deliciously sweet Ethiopian cup. Clove
spice hints mark the dry fragrance, along with perfumed orange smells in our
light roasts. The wet aroma has a canned peach scent that culminates in a
likeness of peach pie with graham cracker crust. As a brewed coffee, Nansebo
pushes a deep level of honey sweetness at a wide range of roasts, City and
City+ roasts striking a nice level of balance between fruited sweetness and a
orange-like brightness. The cooling cup offers glimpses of stone fruit and
citrus notes too, tart apricot, nectarine, and a slightly underripe orange
flavor register. There&rsquo;s a contrasting, pleasant bittering sensation too that
reminds me of peach skins too, sweet-to-tart flavors rounding out the long
finish. Full City roast bear some darker fruited notes, plum and prune juice,
but in low volume comparatively to core bittersweetness of honey-backed cocoa
powder. Acidity is more muted at Full City too, and I found ours to make
incredible single origin espresso. Espresso shots have focuesed fruited notes,
blueberry and dark chocolate, tenedam spice, fresh coriander, and a nice
citrus zing.</p>

<h2 id="roast-notes">Roast Notes</h2>

<p>I preheated the bucket, but didn&rsquo;t try anything special to cool down the beans
quickly.  While writing up these notes I noticed that I could hear the beans a
little bit; not cracking or crackling, but presumably still doing something, so
I poured the beans into a cookie sheet to allow them to cool faster.  I would
like to start doing that normally.</p>

<h2 id="cupping">Cupping</h2>

<p>Acidity: Light acidity at the front in the beginning, quickly overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Sweetness: Chocolaty sweetness that reminds me viscerally of chocolate ice
cream.</p>

<p>Mouthfeel: Almost chalky, contributing to the chocolate flavor.</p>

<p>Flavor:  Chocolate and the fruity undertones of dark chocolate.</p>

<p>Finish: Chocolate!</p>

<p>Balance: This is good, but we&rsquo;ll see how I feel before the week is over.</p>
