<blockquote>
<p>The sweetness smelled in the dry fragrance has the pungency of black strap
molasses with peppery tobacco accents. Both City+ and Full City roasts have
potent, rustic sweetness, mixing syrupy fruit smells with earth-toned
bittersweetness. The aroma is quite herbal, and a complex mix of bittersweet
cocoa and green herbals are released on the break. The cup is complex, malt
syrups with bell pepper and burdock root accents as it cools. A note of dried
natural apricot comes up as you move through the cup, along with intense
bittersweet chocolate, and a rustic date sugar accent in the finish. Full
City roasts are brimming with bittering cacao/unsweetened chocolate flavors,
and as the coffee cools, top notes like pipe tobacco, green pepper, peat, and
hickory smoke come through in the finish. This coffee’s body is thick, so
viscous and syrupy. Add to this a muted acidity level, and you have the
makings for a wonderful espresso blend component, or even single origin. This
is a Sumatra that shows well in light roasting, even at City roast, however
my favorite brewed cup was in the City+ to Full City roast range, where earth
tones find balance among rustic syrupy sweetness. I also prefer letting this
coffee rest for a couple days before drinking, allowing the flavor notes to
coalesce</p>

<h2 id="roast-notes">Roast Notes</h2>

<p>First crack was weak and relatively brief.  I tried to avoid cooling the beans
by keeping them inside till right before I poured them into the mixing bowl.  I
am skeptical of the recorded weight loss.</p>
