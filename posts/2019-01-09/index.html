<blockquote>
<p>This Gesha lot makes for an interesting brew to say the least, tea notes
proliferate in both aroma and cup flavors, from pearl jasmine to Assam teas.
The cup is both floral and brisk, a flavor combo not necessarily unique to
Gesha cultivar, but certainly unique to most Latin American coffees. An herbal
sweetness marks the aroma, as do licorice tea, and a palm sugar scent as you
near Full City. This coffee shows exceptionally well in light to middle
roasts, layers of raw sugar sweetness providing a nice backdrop for
contrasting floral hints, and herbaceous tea notes like Earl Grey and
Darjeeling to stand out against. As the cup cools, sweetness builds in
strength, and what starts out as unrefined sugar flavor like demurara, ends up
more in line with the mild molasses flavor of date sugar. The cup has moderate
acidity that comes off very tea-like, but with a citrus element as well (think
black tea with lemon spritz).  And while I don&rsquo;t recommend Full City roasts
for brew, as most of the floral and tea notes will be compromised, it makes
for a chocolate-y and floral espresso. A sweet toffee taste is underscored by
fine, bittersweet cacao bar, and these shots produce incredibly thick body
that weighs heavy on the palate.</p>

<p>It was pretty cold but not windy, so covering the roaster worked pretty well.</p>
