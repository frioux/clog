<blockquote>
<p>City and City+ roasting produce a fresh smelling coffee, sweet honey and
simple syrup allusions are quite attractive in the ground coffee and a
fragrant floral nectar note contrasts nicely. The wet aroma is delicate but
with floral intensity. Honeysuckle and freesia florals are perfumed and
complex and honey sweetness builds in the steam coming off the coffee. Light
roasts are really where it&rsquo;s at with this coffee, constructing a &ldquo;light and
bright&rdquo; cup that brings to mind the floral and tea-like qualities of what we
think of as archetypal characteristics of coffee from the Yirga Cheffe region.
Star jasmine and honeysuckle flowers come to mind when working through the
coffee, a fragrant highlight that triggers a retronasal response. The cup
shows abundant sweetness too in light roasts that when hot has the
transparency of simple syrup or table sugar, shifting to more fragrant honey
as the coffee cools off a bit. Don&rsquo;t take this one beyond City+. Body is on
the thin side, which lends to the delicate nature of the cup characteristics
found on the lighter end of the spectrum.</p>
