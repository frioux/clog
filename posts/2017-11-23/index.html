<p>The dry fragrance of Juanambú has a butter toffee nut smell to it, City and
City+ roasts offer caramel/toffee overtones, with roasted almond and black
walnut smells underneath. The level of sweetness is prominent in the wet
aroma, a scent of fresh baked cinnamon rolls with white icing, and a strong
note of caramelizing sugars. The cup has raw sugar sweetness that comes off in
layers; dark brown sugar, vanilla caramels, malt syrup, and honeyed hints. At
City there is a lemon vibrance that intensifies as the cup cools, tart, and
tea-like, and subtle fruited notes of golden raisin and date pieces pop up.
The finish is sweet in the short run, shifting to a long bittersweet end. This
bittersweetness is more dominant in Full City roasts, but the sweet side of
this equation is really hard to beat, let alone eclipse. I loved the
brightness and fruit notes captured in our light roasts, but this is also a
great option for those looking for coffees suited for 2nd snaps. Juanambú is
made up of really dense beans (as a result of cultivar and altitude) that can
handle high heat without issue.</p>

<hr />

<p>Acidity: I am not sure if it&rsquo;s acidity I&rsquo;m tasting but there is a sour note at
the back when tasting this coffee.  I&rsquo;m torn between calling it sour and &ldquo;bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sweetness: There&rsquo;s an odd smokey sweetness in the finish if this coffee.</p>

<p>Mouthfeel:  Oily.</p>

<p>Flavor: The flavor immediately hits me hard like the smell of coffee from my
childhood.  It&rsquo;s not fruity in any way and reminds me of some kind of crude oil
more than anything.</p>

<p>Finish: I would say this coffee has more finish flavor than flavor, which is
odd.  I don&rsquo;t love it though.</p>

<p>Balance: I don&rsquo;t like this coffee.  I&rsquo;ll see if it grows on me in future
tastings and roastings.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This coffee is almost surely overroasted.  I accidentally got into
second crack and as you can see from the weight loss it was more water loss than
almost anything I&rsquo;ve ever roasted before.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Update (2017-11-25):</strong> This morning (24h after it finished steeping) the
coffee was much more palateable.  I didn&rsquo;t have a chance to re-cup it but if I
remember I will tomorrow.  I&rsquo;ve updated the rating from 2 to 3.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>2017-11-26 Recup</strong></p>

<p>Acidity: There is a tang that originally really bothered me but is much more
muted now.  It&rsquo;s still there, and if I focus on it I am still not a fan, but
it&rsquo;s less front and center.</p>

<p>Sweetness: The sweetness here is somewhat raisiny.  When this first hits my
palate I taste something that I can quite place.  I want to compare it to prunes
maybe.</p>

<p>Mouthfeel: Astringnent. (Weird, opposite of two days ago.)</p>

<p>Flavor: Kindav a prune-y coffee at this point?</p>

<p>Finish: The finish redeems this coffee in a lot of ways.  I taste the prune
flavor the most during the finish.  I&rsquo;m really not sure if it&rsquo;s a prune flavor
or something else.</p>

<p>Balance: So as mentioned yesterday, this coffee is not as bad as I originally
thought.  If I can remember to, I will roast and brew this one ahead of time
enough that it will have mellowed out for daily drinking.</p>
