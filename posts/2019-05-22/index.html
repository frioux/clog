<blockquote>
<p>The cup is both floral and brisk, a flavor combo not necessarily unique to
Gesha cultivar, but certainly unique to most Latin American coffees. The dry
fragrance might lead you to believe otherwise showing more of a cinnamon/sugar
combination that is still alluring, but not the perfumed smell I expected. It
wasn&rsquo;t until breaking through the wetted crust that I uncovered attractive
jasmine flower aromatics, along with wafts of honey and tea. An herbal
sweetness marks the aroma, as do licorice tea, and a palm sugar scent as you
near Full City. This coffee shows well in light to middle roasts, where layers
of raw sugar sweetness are accented by floral hints and an herbaceous
Darjeeling tea note. As the cup cools, sweetness builds in strength, and what
starts out as transparent simple syrup sweetness, ends up with suggestions of
toffee malt and molasses. The cup has moderate acidity that comes off very
tea-like, and with a citrus element as well. And while I don&rsquo;t recommend Full
City roasts for brew, as most of the floral and tea notes will be compromised,
it makes for a chocolate-y and floral espresso. A sweet toffee taste is
underscored by fine, bittersweet cacao bar, and these shots produce incredibly
thick body that weighs heavy on the palate.</p>
