<blockquote>
<p>La Tacita Floral proves that when it comes to espresso, a little Gesha
cultivar goes a long way. To be fair, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> is no small amount, and from the
high level of floral flavor and aroma found in the shot, I&rsquo;d believe it if I
were told this was 100% Gesha cultivar. We roasted several batches of this
blend, and some of my favorites were on the lighter end of the roast
spectrum, but with stretched roast times. For example, a City+ roast that we
might normally achieve in 10 minutes, was dragged out an extra 3 to 4 minutes
by making more incremental adjustments in heat, which allows the coffee to
roast more evenly from the inside out. This also tends to mute acidity a bit,
which for a blend of coffees that have some of the highest acidity scores,
rolling off that intensity in the shot is a good thing. These long but light
roasts could be extracted at a 1:1 ratio (18 grams in / 18 grams out) and
show lemony brilliance without getting overly bright or metallic results. An
up front burst of Meyer lemon quickly fades to floral chocolate flavor that
coats your palate. There&rsquo;s an underlying sweetness that staves off any
bittering flavors that often come with chocolate roast tone, and unbound
floral accent notes proliferate. A strong note of pearl jasmine tea weaves
through the undercurrent of sweetened dark cocao, infusing the shot with
flowery perfumed note that lingers like a stargazer lily, as does a mix of
dark orange, chocolate syrup, and rose water. Our Full City roast was still
loaded with floral overtones and of course dark chocolate, a flavor mix
consistent with high % cacao bar spiked with jasmine flower. There was also a
dark fruit note different from our lighter roasts that comes off like
sweetened pomegranate juice, and with mandarin-like vibrance woven through.
This blend was constructed with espresso in mind, but each of the three
ingredients score 90+ on their own, and so shooting for a dual-use roast for
both brewing and espresso is a more than viable option.</p>

<h2 id="roast-notes">Roast Notes</h2>

<p>It was so hot while I roasted, so cooling the beans may have been less effective
than normal.</p>

<h2 id="cupping">Cupping</h2>

<p>As with the past few roasts, this is a first for me, so I&rsquo;m not quite
callibrated for these flavors.</p>

<p>Acidity: Barely any acidity, at least that I can detect.</p>

<p>Sweetness: Fruity, chocolatey sweetness.</p>

<p>Mouthfeel: Chalky?</p>

<p>Flavor: Same as the sweetness, but generally speaking still really subdued.</p>

<p>Finish: I taste the floral notes in the finish.</p>

<p>Balance: Good coffee, but not the &ldquo;as good as Dumerso&rdquo; I was hoping for.</p>
