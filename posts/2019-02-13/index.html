<blockquote>
<p>Thageini has a big berry-like fragrance coming out of the grinder, red
raspberry and aromatic sugar notes builiding out a sweet smelling profile.
This perfumed mix continues into the wet aroma, smells of fruits cooked with
molasses sugars coming off the steaming coffee crust, and a baking spice note
accenting the steam. Berry and unrefined sugar notes are the first flavors
that come to mind when sipping the hot cup, like red berry cooked down to a
sugary pastry filling, along with an orange rind note that adds a tartness to
the profile. The cool brew further reinforces a fruit and raw sugar centered
cup profile, and a spice note hints at cinnamon powder in the finish. Acidity
is brightest in light roasts, tart citric aspects offering a contrasting, and
somewhat rind-y vibrance. Don&rsquo;t take this coffee beyond Full City as the
sweet, fruited flavors will be compromised. At Full City, however, dark
blueberry and raspberry flavors are powerful, and the brightness that is found
in lighter roasts is much more muted. This works in favor of single origin
Kenyan espresso, no puckering acidity to take away from the delicous dark
berry fruit flavors that make their way into the shot.</p>
