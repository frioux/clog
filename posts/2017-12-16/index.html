<blockquote>
<p>This Dumerso dry-processed lot is a powerhouse in terms of fruit-forward
aromatics. The dry-fragrance has a cornucopia of fruits, raspberry and ripe
blueberry, Turkish apricots, grape juice, along with a substantial backdrop of
bittersweet burnt sugars. The fruits approach floral dimensions, and a start
jasmine note accents the ground coffee. The wet aromatics are equally intense,
a representation of blackberry and strawberry toppings, a hint of dried mango,
and a cacao-like bittersweetness in our roasts closer to Full City. The cup is
predictably, loaded with fruit flavors, an uncompromising array of ripe and
dry fruited notes that roasts north of 2nd snaps do little to tame. From
tropical to temperate, fruits like strawberry, ripe blueberry, fruit lambic,
jack fruit, and pineapple build as the cup temperature cools, and a mixed
berry jam note lingers in the aftertaste. We found City roasts to have a
citric quality too, like orange rind, a tartness that gives off acidic
impression adding structure to the complex range of flavor notes. An
impressive jasmine grace note shows clearly at a fairly wide roast range,
adding to the complex layers of flavor. Full City roasts boast thick body,
sticky fruit flavors, and a healthy backing of high % cacao bar. This coffee
sits very heavy on the palate and keeps delivering through the long
aftertaste.</p>

<h2 id="roast-notes">Roast Notes</h2>

<p>It was particularly windy today, so I tried to use the top of the bread machine
as a sheild against the wind to maintain the heat in the basket.  Additionally,
I put cold packs in the metal bowls while I was roasting in the hopes that the
cold metal bowls would cool off the coffee more when I was pouring back and
forth.  I used a paper towel to ensure that they were dry before pouring back
and forth.  I think it helped.</p>

<p>Interestingly, preheating the basket didn&rsquo;t seem to help as much this time.
Maybe the wind cancelled it out?</p>

<h2 id="cupping">Cupping</h2>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is the first time I cupped AeroPress coffee, so it&rsquo;s hardly
comparable to prior cuppings.</p>

<p>Aroma Comments: I didn&rsquo;t do this right and only sniffed after brewing instead of
during, but it smells nice!</p>

<p>Acidity: There&rsquo;s some tart acidity, much more flavorful in the AeroPress coffee
than in my typical coldbrew.</p>

<p>Sweetness: I don&rsquo;t taste much sweetness.  There&rsquo;s quite a bit in the finish
though.</p>

<p>Mouthfeel: Very oily, likely due to the brew method.</p>

<p>Flavor: I taste the berries but it&rsquo;s hard for me to taste past the brew method.
There&rsquo;s a strange bitter component right before the finish that could be just
this morning&rsquo;s palate.  Hard to say.</p>

<p>Finish: Smooth and creamy.</p>

<p>Balance: Good, but too different for me to sensibly rate.  This is one of my
favorite coffees of all time but I&rsquo;ll need to get reäquainted with it in this
format.</p>
