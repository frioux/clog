<blockquote>
<p>The dry fragrance has a mix of sugar browning and spice smells in light to
middle roasting, dried ginger and molasses, a subtle dried cherry accent.
The wet aroma has a more intense sweetness that comes off like spiced
molasses cookies, characteristics sensed in the dry fragrance gaining
potency, and a whisp of florals comes through when breaking through the
crust. The cup meets expectations set by the aromatic profile, base brown
sugar and molasses flavors build as the cup cools, and baking spice hints
offer pleasant contrast. Florals are very subtle, and most notable when
drinking a hot cup. When the cup cools down the floral aromatic note fades,
leaving behind a flavor compound build on sugar browning sweetness, with
raisin and cinnamon spice accents, as well as a cane juice note in the
finish. There&rsquo;s a lemon rind like brightness that&rsquo;s on the mild side for
Ethiopia, and with a fairly weighty body, this coffee from Woreda Wonago
doubles well as a sweet single origin espresso.</p>

<h2 id="cupping">Cupping</h2>

<p>Acidity: Nice tart acidity right at the very beginning with a weird acidity I
associate with the brown stuff in the middle of walnuts.</p>

<p>Sweetness: A very slight sweetness in the middle that is probably the molasses
flavor.</p>

<p>Mouthfeel: A little thick but not quite oily.</p>

<p>Flavor: Mostly what I taste is the molasses.  Can&rsquo;t place any ginger or cherry,
but definitely do taste some spice.</p>

<p>Finish: This is where it&rsquo;s the most spicey.  Very interesting!</p>

<p>Balance: Solid coffee.</p>
