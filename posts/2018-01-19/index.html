<blockquote>
<p>This Pacamara lot from Alpina has such an interesting herbal sweetness in the
cup. City and City+ roasts have flavors of sweet basil and celery soda, and an
delightful green floral accent note. The fragrance and aroma smell complex,
floral tea and sweet herbaceous notes permeate from the coffee, and the
impressions I get are reminiscent of Maracaturra coffees, the large bean
hybrid of Maragoype and Caturra that is popular in Nicaragua. This coffee
excels as a pour over brew, with well articulated flavor notes discernible in
the cup. Acidity is brilliant in light roasts, like tangy citrus, a vibrance
that holds up as the coffee cools. The level of sweetness is moderate, and
transparent like simple syrup sugar, lending sweetness without the added
molasses flavors that come with sugar in the raw.</p>

<p>Cold day, but I preheated the bowl and that apparently worked really well.  On
top of that I used the dual bowl method of cooling and then when I was done
poured the beans in a cookie sheet.  Seemed to work well.</p>

<h2 id="cupping">Cupping</h2>

<p>Acidity: Slight acidity at the front, which fades fairly quickly, leaving the
flavor fairly sweet in general.</p>

<p>Sweetness: I don&rsquo;t think that this is very sweet, except in contrast after the
acidity fades.</p>

<p>Mouthfeel: Not very oily.</p>

<p>Flavor: I can taste some of the floral notes; might even be able to pick out the
celery flavor.</p>

<p>Finish: This has a very straightforward finish that makes me think of graham
crackers.  Love it.</p>

<p>Balance: This coffee great, like most Salvadoran coffee.  Not the best, but
definitely good.</p>
