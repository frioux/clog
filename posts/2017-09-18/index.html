<p>The dry fragrance touches on brown sugar and vanilla bean smells, along with a
nice dried apple note. There&rsquo;s a clean sweetness in the coffee smells, and the
wet aromatics show characteristics of raw brown sugar, and definitely some
fruit, but hard to put my finger on exactly what. A honey to brown sugar
sweetness is striking in the brewed coffee, and lays a stabilizing groundwork
on which the rest of the profile rests. A marshmallow note accents the cup,
along with green tea, and a flavor of apple and walnut that carries through to
a clean aftertaste. Acidity is mild-to-moderate, but a tea-like cleanliness
pulls the finish to a point. This coffee performed well for us at a wide range
of roasts, and a great candidate for those who appreciate the roast toned
bittersweetness that comes with 2nd snaps. Crisp, sweet, balanced, and clean,
this is a coffee with staying power: meaning, yes, we&rsquo;d drink it every day.</p>

<p>This came out incredibly well.  To me it tastes like some kind of Christmas
drink.  Clean but with lots of interesting flavors.  I taste nuts and vanilla.
Also definitely some of the apple flavors.  I hope other times I roast this it&rsquo;s
as good.</p>
