<blockquote>
<p>This Matalapa lot is an approachable cup, balanced core coffee flavors, and
infinitely drinkable. The dry fragrance from the ground coffee has hazelnuts
and honey granola scents, while the wet aromatics give a more volatile
aromatic emphasis to the dry fragrance, praline, almonds and a hint of dried
fruit. The cup flavors add to this a unique green tea accent at City+ roast,
with the cup dominated by layered caramel and nutty roast tones, and a twist
of orange rind in the finish. Body is moderate at this level, and at Full
City seems much more dense and opaque, as do the accompanying bittersweet
cocoa roast tones. It has mild acidity, and at City+ finds balance between
brightness, flavor and body. Finca Matalapa makes for a classic-toned SO
espresso at Full City roast, heavy cocoa roast flavor is accented by an
orange zest note, and followed by creamy macadamia nut in the aftertaste.</p>

<h2 id="roast-notes">Roast Notes</h2>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t prewarm the roasting bowl as much as I normally do.</p>

<h2 id="cupping">Cupping</h2>

<p>Acidity: Very low key acidity.  Not especially bright or dark.</p>

<p>Sweetness: Just a touch of sweetness on the back of my tongue.</p>

<p>Mouthfeel: The slightest bit oily.</p>

<p>Flavor: I taste all of the green tea, nutty, and dried fruit flavors.</p>

<p>Finish: The fruit notes of dark chocolate come out in the finish.  Pleasant.</p>

<p>Balance: Good.  Not as straightforward as most Salvadoran coffees, but also
probably better than most Salvadoran coffees!</p>
