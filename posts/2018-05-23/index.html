<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;re really pleased with this year&rsquo;s lot of Baaroo. A balanced coffee,
Baaroo&rsquo;s profile has just the right levels of complex sugar browning sweetness
and subtle top notes to reflect coffees from the origin. The dry fragrance has
a smell of dark toffee, so sweet and candy-like, with an understated peach
note of the canned, syrupy sweet variety. Adding hot water sees a boost in
stone fruit aromatics, like apricot and brown sugar,, as well as a peak in
sugary sweetness, a maple icing scent filling the steam. Baaroo is extremely
versatile, and great at both light and dark roast levels. Notes of stone fruit
reductions with unrefined sugars prevail across the roast spectrum, and darker
roasts develop deep chocolate roast tones. Oddly enough, the floral side is
most present in the hot cup, faint jasmine and lemon oil accent a honey-sweet
cup. The cooler temperature allows for profile expansion and depth, and the
profile is filled out with notes of raw honey, baking spices, slab apricot,
and a well-integrated lemony acidity. There is a mingling of rindy citrus and
cacao nibs in the finish too that interplay with one another nicely. Body is
juicy, even at City roast level, and translates into great mouthfeel as both
brewed coffee and espresso. Espresso shots of a Full City roast extract a rich
chocolate syrup flavor, along with orange juice and licorice accents, and
undeniable citrus brightness but without overpowering the shot.</p>
